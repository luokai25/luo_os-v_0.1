## Sound Wave Fundamentals
```
Sound wave: longitudinal pressure wave in elastic medium.
  Displacement: s(x,t) = s₀cos(kx - ωt)
  Pressure:     p(x,t) = p₀sin(kx - ωt)   (90° out of phase with displacement)
  p₀ = ρ₀vω·s₀  (pressure amplitude)

Wave equation:
  ∂²s/∂t² = v²∂²s/∂x²
  v = speed of sound

Speed of sound:
  General: v = √(B/ρ)  (B = bulk modulus, ρ = density)
  Ideal gas: v = √(γP/ρ) = √(γRT/M)
  Air at 20°C: v = 343 m/s
  Air: v(T) ≈ 331 + 0.6T  (T in Celsius, v in m/s)
  Water: v ≈ 1480 m/s
  Steel: v ≈ 5100 m/s
  Solids faster than liquids faster than gases.

Frequency and wavelength:
  v = fλ
  Audible range: 20 Hz - 20 kHz
  Infrasound: f < 20 Hz
  Ultrasound:  f > 20 kHz
  λ in air at 20°C: λ = 343/f  (17 m at 20 Hz, 17 mm at 20 kHz)
```

## Sound Intensity & Decibels
```
Intensity:
  I = P/A = p₀²/2ρv = ½ρvω²s₀²
  Units: W/m²
  Threshold of hearing: I₀ = 10⁻¹² W/m²
  Pain threshold: ~1 W/m²

Decibel scale:
  Sound level: β = 10·log₁₀(I/I₀)  dB
  Inverse square law: I = P_source/(4πr²)  (point source, free field)
  β drops 6 dB per doubling of distance.

Common sound levels:
  0 dB:   threshold of hearing
  20 dB:  whisper
  60 dB:  normal conversation
  85 dB:  hearing damage threshold (prolonged)
  90 dB:  lawn mower
  120 dB: rock concert, jet at 100m (pain threshold)
  140 dB: gunshot, jet engine nearby

Adding intensities:
  Total intensity = ΣI  (add intensities, not dB directly)
  Two equal sources: β_total = β₁ + 3 dB
  10 identical sources: β_total = β₁ + 10 dB

Acoustic power:
  Sound power level: Lw = 10·log₁₀(W/W₀)  W₀ = 10⁻¹² W
  Directivity: Q = I(θ,φ)/I_avg
```

## Wave Phenomena
```
Reflection:
  Angle of incidence = angle of reflection
  Hard boundary (wall): pressure antinode, displacement node
  Soft boundary (open end): pressure node, displacement antinode
  Acoustic impedance: Z = ρv  (characteristic impedance)
  Reflection coefficient: R = (Z₂-Z₁)/(Z₂+Z₁)
  Transmission coefficient: T = 2Z₂/(Z₂+Z₁)

Refraction (Snell's law):
  sinθ₁/v₁ = sinθ₂/v₂
  Sound bends toward lower speed regions.
  Temperature gradients → atmospheric refraction.

Diffraction:
  Sound bends around obstacles when λ ≥ obstacle size.
  Low frequencies diffract more than high.
  Explains: can hear around corners (low f), not see.

Interference:
  Constructive: path difference = nλ
  Destructive: path difference = (n+½)λ
  Beats: two close frequencies f₁,f₂
    Beat frequency: fbeat = |f₁ - f₂|
    Perceived as amplitude modulation at fbeat.
```

## Resonance & Standing Waves
```
Standing wave: superposition of two traveling waves in opposite directions.
  s(x,t) = 2s₀sin(kx)cos(ωt)
  Nodes: s = 0 always (kx = nπ)
  Antinodes: maximum amplitude (kx = (n+½)π)

Strings (fixed at both ends):
  Boundary condition: nodes at x=0 and x=L
  Harmonics: fn = n·v/2L  n = 1,2,3,...
  Fundamental (n=1): f₁ = v/2L
  Overtones: f₂=2f₁, f₃=3f₁, ... (harmonic series)
  Wave speed on string: v = √(T/μ)  (T=tension, μ=linear density)

Open pipe (open at both ends):
  Pressure nodes at both ends (displacement antinodes)
  fn = n·v/2L  n = 1,2,3,...  (same as string)
  All harmonics present.

Closed pipe (closed at one end):
  Displacement node at closed end, antinode at open end.
  fn = n·v/4L  n = 1,3,5,...  (odd harmonics only)
  Fundamental: f₁ = v/4L

3D resonance (room modes):
  Room modes: f = (v/2)√((nx/Lx)² + (ny/Ly)² + (nz/Lz)²)
  Axial (1D), tangential (2D), oblique (3D) modes.
```

## Doppler Effect
```
Moving source, stationary observer:
  f_obs = f_source · v/(v ∓ vs)
  - (minus): source approaching → higher frequency
  + (plus):  source receding → lower frequency

Moving observer, stationary source:
  f_obs = f_source · (v ± vo)/v
  + (plus):  observer approaching → higher frequency

General (both moving):
  f_obs = f_source · (v + vo)/(v + vs)
  Sign convention: positive toward each other.

Mach number:
  M = vs/v  (ratio of source speed to sound speed)
  M < 1: subsonic, M = 1: sonic, M > 1: supersonic

Shock wave (sonic boom):
  Formed when M > 1 (source faster than sound)
  Mach cone half-angle: sinα = 1/M = v/vs
  Bow wave — like boat wake in water.

Applications:
  Police radar: microwave Doppler → vehicle speed
  Medical ultrasound: blood flow velocity measurement
  Astronomy: stellar radial velocities (redshift/blueshift)
  Weather radar: Doppler wind measurement

## Musical Acoustics
```
Harmonic series:
  f, 2f, 3f, 4f, 5f, 6f, ...
  Determines timbre (tone quality) of instruments.
  More high harmonics → brighter, more nasal sound.

Musical intervals (equal temperament, 12-TET):
  Octave:      frequency ratio 2:1  (1200 cents)
  Perfect 5th: 2^(7/12) ≈ 1.498  (700 cents)
  Major 3rd:   2^(4/12) ≈ 1.260  (400 cents)
  Semitone:    2^(1/12) ≈ 1.0595

Just intonation:
  Perfect 5th: 3/2 = 1.500  (pure, no beats)
  Major 3rd:   5/4 = 1.250
  Pythagorean comma: 12 perfect 5ths ≠ 7 octaves

Instrument acoustics:
  Strings: v = √(T/μ), f = nv/2L
  Bowed strings: stick-slip mechanism → sawtooth wave
  Wind instruments: pipe resonances + reed/lip vibrations
  Percussion: 2D membrane modes, bar and plate modes
  Voice: vocal tract resonances (formants) shape spectrum

Psychoacoustics of music:
  Missing fundamental: brain perceives pitch even without f₁
  Consonance/dissonance: related to frequency ratios
  Masking: loud sound hides softer nearby sounds
  Timbre: attack, spectral content, vibrato all contribute
```

## Ultrasound
```
Medical ultrasound:
  Frequency: 1-20 MHz (higher f → better resolution, less penetration)
  λ = v/f = 1540/f  (1540 m/s in soft tissue)
  At 5 MHz: λ = 0.3 mm (axial resolution ~λ/2)

Pulse-echo imaging:
  Short pulse sent, echoes timed → depth = v·t/2
  A-mode: amplitude vs depth
  B-mode: brightness 2D image
  M-mode: motion over time

Doppler ultrasound:
  Blood flow: f_shift = 2f₀·v·cosθ/c
  Color Doppler: flow direction coded by color
  Pulsed Doppler: flow at specific depth

Acoustic properties of tissue:
  Impedance: Z = ρv
  Reflection at boundary: R = (Z₂-Z₁)²/(Z₂+Z₁)²
  Attenuation: α ≈ 0.5 dB/cm/MHz (soft tissue)
  Coupling gel: eliminates air interface (Z_air << Z_tissue)

Industrial ultrasound:
  Nondestructive testing (NDT): flaw detection in materials
  Phased array: electronic beam steering
  Thickness gauging: v·t/2
  Sonar: underwater ranging and imaging
  Ultrasonic cleaning: cavitation removes contaminants
```

            'Works best: low frequency, confined paths',
            'Applications: headphones, HVAC ducts, car cabins'
        ]
    }

    """
    Mass law for sound insulation.
    TL = 20·log10(m·f) - 42  (dB, approximate)
    """

```

## Psychoacoustics
```
Hearing range:
  Frequency: 20 Hz - 20 kHz (decreases with age)
  Intensity: 0 dB - ~120 dB (dynamic range ~120 dB)

Equal loudness contours (Fletcher-Munson):
  Ear most sensitive at 1-4 kHz.
  Need more SPL at low/high frequencies for equal loudness.
  A-weighting: filter mimicking ear sensitivity.
  dBA: A-weighted decibels for human noise assessment.

Loudness:
  Unit: phon (at 1kHz: 1 phon = 1 dB SPL)
  Sone scale: 1 sone = 40 phon, doubles every 10 phon
  10 dB increase ≈ doubling of perceived loudness (approximate)

Pitch perception:
  Place theory: different frequencies excite different cochlear regions
  Temporal theory: firing rate encodes frequency (low f only)
  Missing fundamental: pitch perceived at f₁ even if absent
  Just noticeable difference (JND): ~0.3-0.5% in frequency

Masking:
  Simultaneous masking: loud sound hides softer nearby frequency
  Temporal masking: loud sound affects perception before/after
  Critical bandwidth: ~1/3 octave (Bark scale)
  Basis for MP3/perceptual audio coding

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Adding decibels directly | Convert to intensity first, then add, then convert back |
| Confusing frequency and pitch | Pitch is psychoacoustic, frequency is physical |
| Open pipe = closed pipe modes | Open: all harmonics, Closed: odd harmonics only |
| Sound travels faster in hot air | v = √(γRT/M) — higher T → faster v |
| Doubling distance = -3dB | Point source free field: -6 dB per distance doubling |
| Reverberation = echo | Echo: distinct reflection >50ms, Reverb: many overlapping reflections |
