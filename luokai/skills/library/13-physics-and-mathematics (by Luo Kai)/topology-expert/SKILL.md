## Topological Spaces
```
Topological space (X, τ):
  X = set of points
  τ = collection of open sets (topology on X)

Axioms for τ:
  1. ∅ ∈ τ and X ∈ τ
  2. Arbitrary unions: {Uα} ⊆ τ → ∪Uα ∈ τ
  3. Finite intersections: U,V ∈ τ → U∩V ∈ τ

Closed sets: complements of open sets
  ∅, X are both open and closed
  Finite unions of closed sets are closed
  Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed

Examples of topologies:
  Discrete topology: τ = P(X) (all subsets open)
  Indiscrete topology: τ = {∅, X}  (coarsest)
  Euclidean: standard open sets in ℝⁿ (usual topology)
  Subspace: if A ⊆ X, τ_A = {U∩A: U∈τ}
  Product: X×Y with basis {U×V: U∈τX, V∈τY}
  Quotient: X/~ where U open ↔ π⁻¹(U) open in X

Basis for topology:
  B is a basis if: covers X, B₁∩B₂ contains basis element around each point
  τ = all unions of elements of B
  ℝ: basis = open intervals (a,b)
  ℝⁿ: basis = open balls B(x,r)

Closure and interior:
  cl(A) = smallest closed set containing A = ∩{C: C closed, A⊆C}
  int(A) = largest open set contained in A = ∪{U: U open, U⊆A}
  boundary: ∂A = cl(A) \ int(A)
  Dense: cl(A) = X
  Nowhere dense: int(cl(A)) = ∅
```

---

## Metric Spaces
```
Metric space (X, d):
  d: X×X → [0,∞) satisfying:
  1. d(x,y) = 0 ↔ x = y  (positive definite)
  2. d(x,y) = d(y,x)  (symmetry)
  3. d(x,z) ≤ d(x,y) + d(y,z)  (triangle inequality)

Topology from metric:
  Open ball: B(x,r) = {y: d(x,y) < r}
  Open set: U open ↔ every point has open ball contained in U
  All metric spaces are Hausdorff (T2) and normal (T4)

Convergence in metric spaces:
  xₙ → x: d(xₙ,x) → 0
  Cauchy sequence: ∀ε>0 ∃N: m,n>N → d(xₘ,xₙ) < ε
  Complete: every Cauchy sequence converges
  Examples: ℝⁿ complete, ℚ not complete

Important metric spaces:
  ℝⁿ: Euclidean metric d(x,y) = √Σ(xᵢ-yᵢ)²
  C[a,b]: supremum metric d(f,g) = sup|f(x)-g(x)|  (complete)
  ℓ²: sequences with Σxᵢ² < ∞, d² = Σ(xᵢ-yᵢ)²  (Hilbert space)
  Discrete metric: d(x,y) = 0 if x=y, 1 if x≠y

Baire Category Theorem:
  Complete metric space (or locally compact Hausdorff):
  Countable intersection of dense open sets is dense
  X cannot be written as countable union of nowhere dense sets
  Applications: existence proofs, continuous nowhere differentiable functions

Banach fixed point theorem:
  T: X→X contraction (d(Tx,Ty) ≤ cd(x,y), c<1) on complete metric space
  → Unique fixed point, xₙ = Tⁿx₀ converges to it
  Applications: existence of ODEs, iterative methods
```

## Continuity & Homeomorphisms
```
Continuous function f: X→Y:
  Equivalent definitions:
  1. Preimage of open set is open: f⁻¹(V) open ∀V open in Y
  2. Preimage of closed set is closed
  3. Sequential continuity: xₙ→x → f(xₙ)→f(x)  (metric spaces)
  4. ε-δ definition (metric spaces)

Homeomorphism:
  f: X→Y bijective, f continuous, f⁻¹ continuous
  X and Y are homeomorphic (X ≅ Y): topologically identical
  Key insight: topology studies properties preserved under homeomorphism

Topological invariants (preserved by homeomorphism):
  Compactness, connectedness, path-connectedness
  Hausdorff property, metrizability
  Fundamental group, homology groups
  Euler characteristic
  NOT: distances, angles, areas, being a manifold of specific dimension

Examples of homeomorphic spaces:
  (0,1) ≅ ℝ  (via x↦tan(π(x-1/2)))
  Open disk ≅ ℝ²
  Circle ≅ boundary of square
  Coffee cup ≅ donut (torus) — one hole each!
  NOT: circle ≇ line segment (circle has no endpoints)
  NOT: sphere ≇ torus (different homology)

Quotient spaces:
  X/~ identifies equivalent points
  [0,1]/(0~1) ≅ S¹ (circle)
  [0,1]²/(boundary) ≅ S² (sphere)
  Möbius band: [0,1]×[0,1] with (0,y)~(1,1-y)
  Torus: [0,1]² with (x,0)~(x,1) and (0,y)~(1,y)
  Klein bottle: (x,0)~(x,1) and (0,y)~(1,1-y)  (non-orientable)
  RP²: sphere with antipodal points identified
```

## Compactness
```
Compact space:
  Every open cover has a finite subcover
  U₁∪U₂∪...=X → finitely many Uᵢ cover X

Heine-Borel theorem (ℝⁿ):
  A ⊆ ℝⁿ compact ↔ A closed and bounded
  ↔ every sequence has convergent subsequence (sequential compactness)

Properties of compact spaces:
  Compact ⊆ Hausdorff → closed
  Continuous image of compact set is compact
  Continuous f: compact → ℝ attains max and min (EVT)
  Compact metric space: complete and totally bounded
  Product of compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem)

Tychonoff's theorem:
  Arbitrary product of compact spaces is compact
  Proof uses Axiom of Choice (actually equivalent to AC)

Sequential compactness:
  Every sequence has a convergent subsequence
  In metric spaces: equivalent to compactness
  Bolzano-Weierstrass: bounded sequence in ℝⁿ has convergent subsequence

Local compactness:
  Every point has compact neighborhood
  ℝⁿ locally compact (but not compact)
  One-point compactification: X* = X ∪ {∞}  (Alexandroff)
```

---

## Connectedness
```
Connected space:
  Cannot be written as union of two disjoint nonempty open sets
  Equivalently: only clopen (open and closed) sets are ∅ and X

Connected subsets of ℝ:
  A ⊆ ℝ connected ↔ A is an interval

Intermediate Value Theorem (topological form):
  f: X→ℝ continuous, X connected
  f takes every value between f(a) and f(b)

Path-connectedness:
  Path: continuous γ: [0,1] → X
  Path-connected: any two points connected by path
  Path-connected → connected (but not conversely!)
  Counter-example: topologist's sine curve {(x,sin(1/x)): x>0} ∪ {(0,0)}

Connected components:
  Maximal connected subsets (partition X)
  Number of components: topological invariant

Local connectedness:
  Every point has arbitrarily small connected neighborhoods
  ℝⁿ locally connected

Simply connected:
  Path-connected + every loop can be contracted to a point
  π₁(X) = {e} (trivial fundamental group)
  ℝⁿ, spheres Sⁿ (n≥2) are simply connected
  Circle S¹, torus are NOT simply connected
```

## Algebraic Topology

### Fundamental Group
```
Homotopy: continuous deformation between paths
  f,g: [0,1]→X paths with same endpoints
  Homotopic: F(s,0)=f(s), F(s,1)=g(s), F(0,t)=x₀, F(1,t)=x₁

Fundamental group π₁(X, x₀):
  Elements: homotopy classes of loops based at x₀
  Operation: concatenation of loops [f]·[g] = [f*g]
  Identity: constant loop [cx₀]
  Inverse: reverse traversal [f⁻¹]

Key fundamental groups:
  π₁(ℝⁿ) = {e}  (contractible)
  π₁(S¹) = ℤ   (winding number)
  π₁(S²) = {e}  (simply connected)
  π₁(T²) = ℤ×ℤ  (torus)
  π₁(RP²) = ℤ/2ℤ
  π₁(figure eight) = F₂ (free group on 2 generators)

Van Kampen's theorem:
  X = U ∪ V (open, path-connected, U∩V path-connected)
  π₁(X) = π₁(U) *_{π₁(U∩V)} π₁(V)  (amalgamated free product)

Covering spaces:
  p: X̃ → X continuous, every x has evenly covered neighborhood
  Fundamental groups related: p₊: π₁(X̃) → π₁(X) injective
  Universal cover X̃: simply connected cover
  π₁(X) acts on fiber p⁻¹(x) freely and transitively
```

### Homology
```
Simplicial homology:
  Triangulate space, compute chain groups and boundary maps
  Hₙ(X) = ker(∂ₙ)/im(∂ₙ₊₁)  (cycles mod boundaries)

Euler characteristic:
  χ(X) = Σₙ (-1)ⁿ rank(Hₙ(X))
  For polyhedra: χ = V - E + F  (vertices - edges + faces)
  Sphere: V-E+F = 2  (Euler formula)
  Torus: V-E+F = 0

Key homology groups:
  Hₙ(Sᵏ) = ℤ if n=0 or n=k, 0 otherwise
  H₀(X) = ℤ^(# connected components)
  Hₙ(Tᵏ) = ℤ^C(k,n)  (torus k-dimensional)

Betti numbers:
  βₙ = rank(Hₙ(X))  (number of n-dimensional holes)
  β₀: connected components
  β₁: independent loops (handles)
  β₂: enclosed voids

Cohomology:
  Hⁿ(X; R): dual to homology (with coefficients in ring R)
  Cup product: Hᵖ⊗Hq → Hᵖ⁺q  (ring structure)
  Poincaré duality: Hₖ(Mⁿ) ≅ Hⁿ⁻ᵏ(Mⁿ) for closed orientable n-manifold
```

---

## Manifolds
```
n-manifold:
  Topological space locally homeomorphic to ℝⁿ
  Hausdorff, second-countable

Surface classification (compact, connected):
  Orientable: connected sum of g tori (genus g)
    g=0: sphere S²
    g=1: torus T²
    g=2: double torus
    Euler characteristic: χ = 2-2g
  Non-orientable: connected sum of k projective planes
    k=1: RP² (projective plane)
    k=2: Klein bottle
    χ = 2-k

Smooth manifolds:
  Atlas: collection of charts (overlapping homeomorphisms to ℝⁿ)
  Smooth: transition maps Cᵢⱼ = φⱼ∘φᵢ⁻¹ are C∞
  Tangent space TₓM: vectors at x (n-dimensional vector space)
  Tangent bundle TM: disjoint union of all tangent spaces

de Rham cohomology:
  Differential forms on smooth manifold
  dω: exterior derivative
  HᵏdR(M) = closed k-forms / exact k-forms
  de Rham theorem: HᵏdR(M) ≅ Hᵏ(M;ℝ)
  Stokes theorem: ∫_M dω = ∫_{∂M} ω

Characteristic classes:
  Obstructions to certain geometric structures
  Stiefel-Whitney (ℤ/2), Chern (complex), Pontryagin (real)

```

## Separation Axioms
```
T₀ (Kolmogorov): distinct points topologically distinguishable
T₁: every singleton {x} is closed
T₂ (Hausdorff): distinct points have disjoint open neighborhoods
  Limits of sequences are unique
  Most spaces in analysis are Hausdorff
T₃ (Regular + T₁): point and closed set have disjoint neighborhoods
T₃½ (Tychonoff/completely regular + T₁)
T₄ (Normal + T₁): two disjoint closed sets have disjoint neighborhoods
  Urysohn's lemma: T₄ ↔ continuous function separating closed sets
  Tietze extension theorem: continuous f on closed A extends to all X

Hierarchy: T₄ → T₃½ → T₃ → T₂ → T₁ → T₀
Metric spaces: normal (T₄)
Compact Hausdorff: normal
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Path-connected = connected | Path-connected → connected, NOT converse |
| Compact = closed and bounded | Only in ℝⁿ (Heine-Borel); general: use open cover definition |
| Homeomorphic = isometric | Homeomorphism preserves topology only, not distances |
| Continuous = open map | Continuous maps need not send open sets to open sets |
| Simply connected = contractible | S² is simply connected but not contractible |
| π₁ detects all holes | π₁ only detects 1D holes; need higher homotopy/homology for others |
