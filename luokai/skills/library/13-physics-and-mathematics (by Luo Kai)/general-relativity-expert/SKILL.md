## Foundations & Philosophy
```
Key idea: Gravity is not a force — it is the curvature of spacetime.
          Massive objects curve spacetime.
          Objects follow geodesics (straightest paths) in curved spacetime.

Equivalence Principle:
  Weak EP:   Gravitational mass = Inertial mass
  Einstein EP: In a freely falling frame, physics is locally SR.
  Strong EP:  Laws of physics same in all frames (including gravity).

Mach's Principle:
  Inertia of objects determined by distribution of all matter.
  Motivated Einstein but not fully incorporated in GR.

Geometric units:
  G = c = 1 (often used in GR literature)
  Length = time = mass in these units.
```

## Tensor Calculus
```
Metric tensor gᵘᵛ:
  ds² = gᵘᵛ dxᵘ dxᵛ
  gᵘᵛ raises indices: Vᵘ = gᵘᵛ Vᵥ
  gᵘᵥ lowers indices: Vᵘ = gᵘᵛ Vᵥ
  gᵘᵛ gᵥᵨ = δᵘᵨ

Christoffel symbols (connection):
  Γᵨᵘᵛ = ½gᵨλ(∂ᵘgᵛλ + ∂ᵛgᵘλ - ∂λgᵘᵛ)
  Not a tensor — coordinate dependent.

Covariant derivative:
  ∇ᵘVᵛ = ∂ᵘVᵛ + ΓᵛᵘλVλ
  ∇ᵘVᵥ = ∂ᵘVᵥ - ΓλᵘᵥVλ
  ∇ᵘgᵥᵨ = 0 (metric compatibility)

Riemann curvature tensor:
  Rᵨᵘᵛλ = ∂ᵛΓᵨᵘλ - ∂λΓᵨᵘᵛ + ΓᵨᵛσΓσᵘλ - ΓᵨλσΓσᵘᵛ
  Measures failure of parallel transport around loop.
  Flat spacetime: Rᵨᵘᵛλ = 0

Ricci tensor:   Rᵘᵛ = Rλᵘλᵛ  (contraction)
Ricci scalar:   R = gᵘᵛRᵘᵛ
Einstein tensor: Gᵘᵛ = Rᵘᵛ - ½gᵘᵛR
∇ᵘGᵘᵛ = 0  (Bianchi identity — energy conservation)
```

---

## Einstein Field Equations
```
Einstein Field Equations (EFE):
  Gᵘᵛ = 8πG/c⁴ · Tᵘᵛ
  or with cosmological constant:
  Gᵘᵛ + Λgᵘᵛ = 8πG/c⁴ · Tᵘᵛ

Left side:  geometry (curvature of spacetime)
Right side: matter and energy content

Energy-momentum tensor Tᵘᵛ:
  T⁰⁰ = energy density
  T⁰ⁱ = energy flux / momentum density
  Tⁱʲ = stress tensor
  ∇ᵘTᵘᵛ = 0 (conservation of energy-momentum)

Perfect fluid:
  Tᵘᵛ = (ρ + P/c²)UᵘUᵛ + Pgᵘᵛ
  ρ = energy density, P = pressure, Uᵘ = four-velocity

Vacuum equations (Tᵘᵛ = 0):
  Rᵘᵛ = 0  (not flat spacetime — just Ricci flat)
  Gravitational waves, Schwarzschild are vacuum solutions.

Wheeler's summary:
  "Spacetime tells matter how to move;
   matter tells spacetime how to curve."
```

## Geodesic Equation
```
Geodesic: path of free-falling particle (no forces except gravity).
          Generalizes straight line to curved spacetime.

Equation:
  d²xᵘ/dτ² + Γᵘᵥλ (dxᵛ/dτ)(dxλ/dτ) = 0

Timelike geodesics: massive particles (dτ² > 0)
Null geodesics:     light rays (dτ = 0, ds² = 0)

Geodesic deviation:
  D²ξᵘ/dτ² = -Rᵘᵥλσ (dxᵛ/dτ) ξλ (dxσ/dτ)
  Describes tidal forces — nearby geodesics diverge/converge.
```

---

## Schwarzschild Solution
```
Vacuum solution outside spherical mass M:
  ds² = -(1-rs/r)c²dt² + dr²/(1-rs/r) + r²dΩ²
  dΩ² = dθ² + sin²θ dφ²

Schwarzschild radius: rs = 2GM/c²
  Sun:   rs = 2.95 km
  Earth: rs = 8.87 mm
  Proton: rs = 2.5×10⁻⁵⁴ m

Singularities:
  r = rs: coordinate singularity (event horizon)
           can be removed by coordinate change
  r = 0:  physical singularity (infinite curvature)

Gravitational redshift:
  f_obs/f_emit = √(1 - rs/r_emit) / √(1 - rs/r_obs)
  Clock near massive object ticks slower.
  GPS correction: ~45 μs/day faster (GR) - 7 μs/day slower (SR)
  Net: +38 μs/day must be corrected.

Orbital mechanics:
  Effective potential: Veff = -GM/r + L²/2μr² - GML²/μc²r³
  Extra term: purely GR — causes perihelion precession.
  Mercury precession: 43 arcsec/century (GR prediction ✓)
```

## Black Holes
```
Schwarzschild Black Hole:
  Event horizon at r = rs = 2GM/c²
  Nothing (including light) escapes from r < rs.
  Infinite time dilation at horizon for outside observer.
  Infalling observer crosses horizon in finite proper time.

Kerr Black Hole (rotating):
  Described by mass M and spin parameter a = J/Mc.
  Ergosphere: region outside horizon where frame dragging
              forces everything to rotate.
  Penrose process: extract rotational energy from ergosphere.

Reissner-Nordstrom (charged):
  Has inner and outer horizons.

Black hole thermodynamics:
  Temperature: TH = ℏc³/8πGMk  (Hawking temperature)
  Entropy:     S = kA/4lP²     (Bekenstein-Hawking)
               A = 4πrs², lP = √(Gℏ/c³) = Planck length
  First law:   dM = TH dS + ΩH dJ + ΦH dQ
  Second law:  Total black hole area never decreases (classically).

Hawking radiation:
  Black holes emit thermal radiation due to QFT in curved spacetime.
  Black hole evaporates over time: tevap ∝ M³
  Information paradox: unresolved fundamental problem.

Penrose diagrams:
  Conformal diagram showing causal structure.
  45° lines = light rays.
  Compresses infinite spacetime into finite diagram.
```

## Gravitational Waves
```
Linearized gravity: gᵘᵛ = ηᵘᵛ + hᵘᵛ  (|hᵘᵛ| << 1)

Wave equation (Lorenz gauge):
  □h̄ᵘᵛ = -16πG/c⁴ Tᵘᵛ
  h̄ᵘᵛ = hᵘᵛ - ½ηᵘᵛh  (trace-reversed)

Transverse-traceless (TT) gauge:
  Two polarizations: h₊ and h×
  h₊: stretches x, squeezes y (and vice versa)
  h×: 45° rotation of h₊

Quadrupole formula (leading order emission):
  Pᵍʷ = G/5c⁵ · ⟨Q̈ᵢⱼQ̈ᵢⱼ⟩  (power radiated)
  Qᵢⱼ = ∫ρ(xᵢxⱼ - ⅓δᵢⱼr²) dV  (quadrupole moment)

Detection:
  LIGO/Virgo: laser interferometers, arm length L ~ 4 km
  Strain: h = ΔL/L ~ 10⁻²¹ (GW150914 first detection 2015)
  Sources: binary black holes, neutron star mergers, supernovae

GW150914 (first detection):
  Two black holes: 36 M☉ and 29 M☉
  Merged to 62 M☉ — 3 M☉ radiated as gravitational waves!
  Peak luminosity: ~3.6×10⁴⁹ W (outshone all visible universe)
```

## Cosmology (FLRW)
```
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric:
  ds² = -c²dt² + a(t)²[dr²/(1-kr²) + r²dΩ²]
  a(t) = scale factor, k = curvature (0,±1)

Friedmann equations:
  H² = (ȧ/a)² = 8πGρ/3 - kc²/a² + Λc²/3
  ä/a = -4πG/3(ρ + 3P/c²) + Λc²/3

Hubble parameter: H = ȧ/a = H₀ ≈ 67-74 km/s/Mpc

Density parameters:
  Ωm = 8πGρm/3H²  (matter)
  ΩΛ = Λc²/3H²    (dark energy)
  Ωk = -kc²/a²H²  (curvature)
  Ωm + ΩΛ + Ωk = 1

Current values:
  Ωm ≈ 0.31  (ordinary + dark matter)
  ΩΛ ≈ 0.69  (dark energy)
  Ωk ≈ 0     (spatially flat)

Cosmological redshift:
  1 + z = a(t_obs)/a(t_emit) = 1/a(t_emit)

Big Bang, inflation, dark energy expansion.
Age of universe: ~13.8 billion years.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Gravity as a force | GR: gravity is spacetime curvature, no force |
| Schwarzschild radius = size of object | rs is event horizon only if all mass inside rs |
| Nothing special at event horizon locally | Infalling observer feels nothing special crossing horizon |
| Singularity theorem means GR breaks down | Singularities signal GR needs quantum gravity |
| Expansion means galaxies moving through space | Space itself expands — galaxies mostly at rest locally |
| Dark energy is energy in vacuum | Its nature is unknown — cosmological constant is one model |
