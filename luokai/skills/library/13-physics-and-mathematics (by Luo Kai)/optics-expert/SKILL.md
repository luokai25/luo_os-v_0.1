## Geometric Optics

### Reflection & Refraction
```
Law of Reflection:
  θᵢ = θᵣ  (angle of incidence = angle of reflection)
  Both measured from normal to surface.

Snell's Law (Refraction):
  n₁sinθ₁ = n₂sinθ₂
  n = c/v = refractive index (n ≥ 1)

Common refractive indices:
  Vacuum/air: n = 1.000
  Water:      n = 1.333
  Glass:      n = 1.5
  Diamond:    n = 2.42

Total Internal Reflection:
  Occurs when light goes from dense to less dense medium.
  Critical angle: sinθc = n₂/n₁  (n₁ > n₂)
  θᵢ > θc → total reflection, no transmitted ray.

Dispersion:
  n = n(λ) — different wavelengths refract differently.
  Prism separates white light into spectrum.
  Cauchy equation: n(λ) = A + B/λ²
```

### Mirrors
```
Spherical mirror equation:
  1/f = 1/do + 1/di
  f = R/2  (focal length = half radius of curvature)
  M = -di/do  (magnification, negative = inverted)

Sign conventions:
  do > 0: object in front of mirror
  di > 0: real image (in front), di < 0: virtual image (behind)
  f > 0: concave mirror, f < 0: convex mirror

Flat mirror: f = ∞ → di = -do (virtual, upright, same size)
Concave: converging — real images when do > f
Convex: diverging — always virtual, upright, reduced image
```

### Lenses & Ray Tracing
```
Thin lens equation:
  1/f = 1/do + 1/di
  M = -di/do = hi/ho

Lensmaker's equation:
  1/f = (n-1)[1/R₁ - 1/R₂]
  R > 0: center of curvature on transmission side
  R < 0: center of curvature on incidence side

Lens types:
  Converging (convex): f > 0
  Diverging (concave): f < 0

Three principal rays for ray tracing:
  1. Parallel to axis → passes through focal point F'
  2. Through focal point F → emerges parallel to axis
  3. Through optical center → undeviated

Power: P = 1/f  (diopters, f in meters)
Combined lenses: 1/f_total = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ - d/(f₁f₂)
```

## Wave Optics

### Huygens Principle & Wavefronts
```
Every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets.
New wavefront = envelope of all secondary wavelets.
Explains reflection, refraction, diffraction.

Plane wave: E = E₀cos(kx - ωt)
Spherical wave: E = (E₀/r)cos(kr - ωt)
k = 2π/λ (wave number)
Phase velocity: v = ω/k = c/n
```

### Interference
```
Two-source interference (Young's double slit):
  Path difference: Δ = d·sinθ ≈ d·y/L
  Constructive (bright): Δ = mλ      m = 0,±1,±2,...
  Destructive (dark):    Δ = (m+½)λ
  Fringe spacing: Δy = λL/d

Intensity pattern:
  I = 4I₀cos²(πdsinθ/λ)
  I = 4I₀ at maxima, 0 at minima

Conditions for interference:
  Coherence: stable phase relationship between sources
  Coherence length: Lc = λ²/Δλ
  Coherence time: τc = 1/Δf

Thin film interference:
  Path difference: 2nt (for normal incidence)
  Phase shift: π if reflecting from higher n medium
  Constructive: 2nt = (m+½)λ (one phase shift)
  Destructive:  2nt = mλ     (one phase shift)
  → Anti-reflection coatings: t = λ/4n
  → Soap bubbles, oil films, optical coatings
```

---

## Diffraction
```
Single slit diffraction:
  Minima at: a·sinθ = mλ  m = ±1,±2,...
  Central maximum width: 2λ/a
  Intensity: I = I₀[sin(α)/α]²
  α = πa·sinθ/λ

Double slit (combined):
  I = 4I₀cos²(δ/2)[sin(α)/α]²
  δ = 2πd·sinθ/λ  (interference term)
  α = πa·sinθ/λ   (diffraction envelope)

Diffraction grating:
  Principal maxima: d·sinθ = mλ
  d = grating spacing, m = order
  Resolving power: R = λ/Δλ = mN  (N = number of slits)

Rayleigh criterion (resolution limit):
  θmin = 1.22λ/D  (circular aperture)
  Two sources just resolved when one max falls on other's min.

Fresnel vs Fraunhofer:
  Fraunhofer: far field (L >> a²/λ) — parallel rays
  Fresnel: near field — curved wavefronts
```

## Polarization
```
Linear polarization: E oscillates in single plane
Circular polarization: E rotates — equal amplitudes, 90° phase diff
Elliptical polarization: general case

Malus's Law:
  I = I₀cos²θ  (intensity through polarizer at angle θ)

Brewster's Angle (polarization by reflection):
  tanθB = n₂/n₁
  At θB: reflected light is completely s-polarized
  Transmitted light: partially p-polarized

Birefringence:
  Two different refractive indices: no and ne
  Ordinary ray (o-ray): follows Snell's law
  Extraordinary ray (e-ray): does not

Wave plates:
  Quarter-wave plate (QWP): Δφ = π/2
    Linear → circular polarization (and vice versa)
  Half-wave plate (HWP): Δφ = π
    Rotates linear polarization by 2θ

Jones vectors and matrices:
  Horizontal: [1,0], Vertical: [0,1]
  Right circular: [1,-i]/√2
  HWP matrix: [[cos2θ, sin2θ],[sin2θ, -cos2θ]]
```

## Lasers
```
Laser = Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation

Key concepts:
  Spontaneous emission: random photon emission
  Stimulated emission: incident photon triggers identical photon
  Population inversion: more atoms in excited state than ground state
  → Required for amplification (not thermal equilibrium)

Three/four level systems:
  Three-level: difficult — must depopulate ground state
  Four-level: easier — lasing transition between two excited states
  Ruby laser (3-level), Nd:YAG (4-level)

Laser cavity:
  Two mirrors (one partially transmitting) → standing wave modes
  Mode spacing: Δν = c/2L
  Longitudinal modes: integer wavelengths fit in cavity

Gaussian beam:
  w(z) = w₀√(1 + (z/zR)²)
  zR = πw₀²/λ  (Rayleigh range)
  w₀ = beam waist (minimum radius)
  Beam divergence: θ = λ/πw₀  (diffraction limited)

Laser properties:
  Coherence: long coherence length
  Monochromaticity: narrow linewidth
  Directionality: small divergence
  High intensity: concentrated beam

Common laser types:
  HeNe:   λ = 632.8 nm (red, gas laser)
  CO₂:    λ = 10.6 μm  (infrared, cutting)
  Nd:YAG: λ = 1064 nm  (solid state, pulsed)
  Diode:  various λ    (semiconductor, compact)
  Ti:Sapphire: tunable (ultrafast pulses)
```

## Fiber Optics
```
Total internal reflection guides light in fiber core.
Core: higher n, Cladding: lower n
Numerical aperture: NA = √(n_core² - n_clad²) = n·sinθmax

Step-index fiber:
  Sharp boundary between core and cladding.
  Multimode: large core, many propagating modes.
  Single-mode: small core (~8μm), one mode, low dispersion.

Graded-index fiber:
  n decreases gradually from center.
  Reduces intermodal dispersion.

Dispersion types:
  Modal: different modes travel at different speeds
  Chromatic: different wavelengths travel at different speeds
  Material: from dn/dλ
  Waveguide: from fiber geometry

Attenuation:
  Measured in dB/km
  Minimum at λ = 1550 nm (~0.2 dB/km for silica)
  Telecom windows: 1310 nm, 1550 nm

Applications:
  Long-distance communication, endoscopy, sensors

    near = (hyp * distance) / (hyp + distance - focal_length)

        'hyperfocal': round(hyp, 2)
    }

## Aberrations
```
Monochromatic aberrations (Seidel):
  Spherical aberration: marginal rays focus differently than paraxial
  Coma: off-axis point sources form comet shape
  Astigmatism: different focal lengths in two planes
  Field curvature: flat object focuses on curved surface
  Distortion: magnification varies with field height

Chromatic aberration:
  Longitudinal: different colors focus at different distances
  Transverse: different colors have different magnifications
  Correction: achromatic doublet (crown + flint glass)

Zernike polynomials:
  Mathematical basis for describing wavefront aberrations.
  Used in adaptive optics and ophthalmology.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Sign convention errors in lens/mirror | Define positive direction consistently |
| Forgetting phase shift on reflection | π phase shift when reflecting from denser medium |
| Rayleigh vs Abbe resolution | Rayleigh for telescopes, Abbe for microscopes |
| Ignoring coherence for interference | Interference only visible with coherent sources |
| Paraxial approximation failure | Valid only for small angles sinθ ≈ θ |
| Confusing focal length and focal point | f is distance, F is the point |
