## Complex Numbers & Basic Topology
```
Complex number: z = x + iy (x,y ∈ ℝ, i² = -1)
  Real part: Re(z) = x, Imaginary part: Im(z) = y
  Modulus: |z| = √(x²+y²)
  Argument: arg(z) = θ where z = |z|e^(iθ)
  Complex conjugate: z̄ = x - iy

Properties:
  |z|² = zz̄
  |z₁z₂| = |z₁||z₂|
  arg(z₁z₂) = arg(z₁) + arg(z₂)
  Triangle inequality: |z₁+z₂| ≤ |z₁|+|z₂|

Euler's formula: e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ
  e^(iπ) + 1 = 0  (Euler's identity)
  z = re^(iθ): polar form

De Moivre: (cosθ+i sinθ)ⁿ = cos(nθ)+i sin(nθ)
  nth roots: w = r^(1/n) e^(i(θ+2πk)/n) for k=0,1,...,n-1

Riemann sphere: ℂ ∪ {∞} (one-point compactification)
  Stereographic projection: sphere ↔ extended complex plane

Topology of ℂ:
  Open disk: Dᵣ(z₀) = {z: |z-z₀| < r}
  Connected, simply connected regions
  Winding number: n(γ,z₀) = (1/2πi)∮_γ dz/(z-z₀)
```

---

## Complex Differentiation
```
Derivative: f'(z₀) = lim_{z→z₀} [f(z)-f(z₀)]/(z-z₀)
  Limit must be same from ALL directions in ℂ

Cauchy-Riemann equations:
  f = u + iv holomorphic ↔ ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y  and  ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x
  In polar: ∂u/∂r = (1/r)∂v/∂θ, (1/r)∂u/∂θ = -∂v/∂r
  f'(z) = ∂u/∂x + i∂v/∂x = ∂v/∂y - i∂u/∂y

Holomorphic (analytic): f differentiable in open set U
  Much stronger than real differentiability!
  Holomorphic ↔ infinitely differentiable
  Holomorphic ↔ locally given by convergent power series

Entire function: holomorphic on all of ℂ
  Examples: polynomials, eˢ, sin z, cos z

Meromorphic: holomorphic except at isolated poles

CR equations and harmonicity:
  If f = u+iv holomorphic: u and v are harmonic
  ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0  (Laplace equation)
  v is harmonic conjugate of u
  Given harmonic u, can find v by integrating CR equations
```

## Elementary Complex Functions
```
Exponential:
  eˢ = eˣ(cos y + i sin y)  for z = x+iy
  Periodic: e^(z+2πi) = eˢ
  Never zero: eˢ ≠ 0 for all z

Complex trig and hyperbolic:
  sin z = (e^(iz) - e^(-iz))/2i    cos z = (e^(iz) + e^(-iz))/2
  sinh z = (eˢ - e^(-z))/2         cosh z = (eˢ + e^(-z))/2
  sin(iz) = i sinh z,   cos(iz) = cosh z
  |sin z|² = sin²x + sinh²y  (can be > 1!)

Complex logarithm (multivalued):
  Log z = ln|z| + i Arg(z)  (principal value, Arg ∈ (-π,π])
  log z = ln|z| + i(Arg z + 2πk)  k ∈ ℤ
  Not defined at z = 0
  Branch cut: negative real axis for principal value
  d/dz Log z = 1/z  (on cut plane)

Complex power:
  z^w = exp(w log z)  (multivalued in general)
  z^n: unambiguous for integer n
  z^(1/n): n values (nth roots)
  i^i = e^(i·log i) = e^(i·iπ/2) = e^(-π/2) ≈ 0.2079 (real!)

Inverse trig:
  arcsin z = -i log(iz + √(1-z²))
  arctan z = (i/2)log((i+z)/(i-z)) = (i/2)log((1-iz)/(1+iz))
```

## Cauchy Theory
```
Contour integral:
  ∫_γ f(z)dz = ∫ₐᵇ f(γ(t))γ'(t)dt
  ML inequality: |∫_γ f dz| ≤ M·L  (M = max|f|, L = length of γ)

Cauchy's theorem (simply connected domain):
  f holomorphic in simply connected D
  γ closed curve in D → ∮_γ f(z)dz = 0

  Equivalent: ∫_γ₁ f = ∫_γ₂ f (path independence for holomorphic f)
  Antiderivative: F'(z) = f(z) exists → ∫ = F(endpoint) - F(startpoint)

Cauchy's Integral Formula:
  f holomorphic in D, γ simple closed curve in D, z₀ inside γ:
  f(z₀) = (1/2πi) ∮_γ f(z)/(z-z₀) dz

  Higher derivatives:
  f⁽ⁿ⁾(z₀) = (n!/2πi) ∮_γ f(z)/(z-z₀)^(n+1) dz

  Consequence: holomorphic → infinitely differentiable! (unlike real analysis)

Liouville's Theorem:
  Bounded entire function is constant
  Proof: Taylor coefficients bounded → all zero except constant

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (consequence):
  Every non-constant polynomial has a root in ℂ
  Proof: if no root, 1/p(z) bounded entire function → constant

Maximum modulus principle:
  f non-constant holomorphic → |f| has no maximum in interior
  Maximum attained on boundary (for closed bounded region)
  Minimum: |f| has no interior minimum if f ≠ 0
```

---

## Taylor & Laurent Series
```
Taylor series (f holomorphic in disk |z-z₀|<R):
  f(z) = Σₙ₌₀^∞ aₙ(z-z₀)ⁿ
  aₙ = f⁽ⁿ⁾(z₀)/n! = (1/2πi)∮ f(z)/(z-z₀)^(n+1) dz
  Converges absolutely in |z-z₀| < R

Common Taylor series (centered at 0):
  eˢ = Σ zⁿ/n!  (entire)
  sin z = Σ (-1)ⁿz^(2n+1)/(2n+1)!  (entire)
  cos z = Σ (-1)ⁿz^(2n)/(2n)!  (entire)
  1/(1-z) = Σ zⁿ  (|z|<1)
  Log(1+z) = Σ (-1)^(n+1)zⁿ/n  (|z|<1)

Laurent series (f holomorphic in annulus r < |z-z₀| < R):
  f(z) = Σₙ₌₋∞^∞ cₙ(z-z₀)ⁿ
  cₙ = (1/2πi)∮ f(z)/(z-z₀)^(n+1) dz  (any circle in annulus)
  Principal part: Σₙ₌₋∞^(-1) cₙ(z-z₀)ⁿ (negative powers)
  Analytic part: Σₙ₌₀^∞ cₙ(z-z₀)ⁿ

Classification of isolated singularities:
  Removable: Laurent series has no negative powers
    lim_{z→z₀} f(z) exists and is finite
    Example: sin(z)/z at z=0 (has limit 1)
  Pole of order m: Laurent series starts at (z-z₀)^(-m)
    lim_{z→z₀} (z-z₀)ᵐ f(z) exists and ≠ 0
    Simple pole: m=1
  Essential singularity: infinitely many negative power terms
    Casorati-Weierstrass: f(D\{z₀}) dense in ℂ near essential singularity
    Example: e^(1/z) at z=0
```

---

## Residue Calculus
```
Residue of f at z₀:
  Res(f, z₀) = c₋₁ (coefficient of (z-z₀)^(-1) in Laurent series)

Computing residues:
  Simple pole z₀: Res = lim_{z→z₀} (z-z₀)f(z)
  Pole order m: Res = lim_{z→z₀} (1/(m-1)!) d^(m-1)/dz^(m-1) [(z-z₀)ᵐf(z)]
  f = p/q, simple zero of q at z₀: Res = p(z₀)/q'(z₀)

Residue Theorem:
  f meromorphic in D with poles z₁,...,zₙ, γ simple closed curve:
  ∮_γ f(z)dz = 2πi Σₖ n(γ,zₖ) Res(f,zₖ)
  For counterclockwise γ enclosing all poles:
  ∮_γ f(z)dz = 2πi Σₖ Res(f,zₖ)
```

### Real Integral Evaluation
```python
def real_integrals_via_residues():
    return {
        'Rational trig ∫₀²π R(cosθ,sinθ)dθ': {
            'substitution': 'z = e^(iθ): cosθ=(z+z⁻¹)/2, sinθ=(z-z⁻¹)/2i, dθ=dz/iz',
            'becomes':      '∮_{|z|=1} f(z)dz = 2πi × sum of residues inside unit circle'
        },

            'condition':    'f analytic except poles, |zf(z)|→0 as |z|→∞',
            'contour':      'Semicircle in upper half-plane',
            'result':       '∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x)dx = 2πi × sum of residues in upper half-plane'
        },

            'small_semicircle': 'Contributes πi × Res (half residue for simple pole)'
        }
    }
```

## Conformal Mappings
```
Conformal map: angle-preserving bijection between regions
  Holomorphic with f'(z) ≠ 0 → conformal
  Preserves angles AND orientation at non-critical points

Möbius transformations (linear fractional):
  f(z) = (az+b)/(cz+d)  with ad-bc ≠ 0
  Extended ℂ∞ → ℂ∞: maps circles/lines to circles/lines
  Three points determine unique Möbius transformation
  Composition forms group: PSL(2,ℂ)
  Fixed points: solve f(z) = z
  Cross-ratio preserved: (z₁,z₂;z₃,z₄) = (f(z₁),f(z₂);f(z₃),f(z₄))

Important Möbius transformations:
  Unit disk to upper half-plane: f(z) = (z-i)/(z+i)
  Upper half-plane to unit disk: f(z) = (z-i)/(z+i) inverse
  Translation: f(z) = z+c
  Rotation: f(z) = e^(iθ)z
  Dilation: f(z) = rz
  Inversion: f(z) = 1/z

Riemann Mapping Theorem:
  Any simply connected proper subset of ℂ is conformally equivalent to disk
  D = {z: |z|<1}
  f unique if we specify f(z₀) = 0 and f'(z₀) > 0 for some z₀
  Proof uses normal families, Montel's theorem

Standard conformal maps:
  z² : maps right half-plane to ℂ\(-∞,0] (doubles angles at origin)
  √z : inverse of z²
  eˢ : maps horizontal strip 0<Im(z)<π to upper half-plane
  Log z: inverse, maps ℂ\(-∞,0] to strip
  sin z: maps strip |Re(z)|<π/2 conformally
  Joukowski: z + 1/z (aerodynamics, transforms circles to airfoils)

Schwarz-Christoffel formula:
  Map upper half-plane to polygon with interior angles αₖπ:
  f(z) = A ∫ₛ^z Πₖ(t-xₖ)^(αₖ-1) dt + B
  xₖ: preimages of vertices on real axis
```

## Harmonic Functions
```
Harmonic: Δu = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0
  Real and imaginary parts of holomorphic functions are harmonic
  Conversely: given harmonic u, can find harmonic conjugate v (simply connected)
  u+iv then holomorphic

Mean value property:
  u(z₀) = (1/2π)∫₀²π u(z₀+re^(iθ))dθ  (average over circle)
  Maximum principle: harmonic maximum on boundary of bounded region

Poisson integral formula:
  Solve Dirichlet problem: Δu=0 in disk, u=f on boundary
  u(re^(iθ)) = (1/2π)∫₀²π P(r,φ-θ)f(e^(iφ))dφ
  Poisson kernel: P(r,θ) = (1-r²)/(1-2r cosθ+r²)

Green's functions:
  G(z,z₀): Δ_z G = δ(z-z₀), G=0 on boundary
  Solution: u(z₀) = ∫_∂D f(z)∂G/∂n ds

Dirichlet problem:
  Upper half-plane: u(x,y) = (y/π)∫_{-∞}^∞ f(t)/((x-t)²+y²) dt
  (Poisson formula for upper half-plane)
```

## Advanced Topics
```
Analytic continuation:
  Extend holomorphic function beyond original domain
  Unique continuation: if two analytic functions agree on open set, agree everywhere
  Monodromy theorem: continuation on simply connected domain is single-valued
  Log and zʷ: multi-valued due to topology

Riemann surfaces:
  Make multi-valued functions single-valued on larger domain
  log z: cover ℂ\{0} with infinite-sheeted surface
  √z: two-sheeted surface with branch point at 0
  Algebraic functions: compact Riemann surfaces ↔ algebraic curves

Infinite products:
  Weierstrass factorization: entire f with zeros {aₙ}:
  f(z) = zᵐeᵍ⁽ˢ⁾ Πₙ (1-z/aₙ)exp(z/aₙ+z²/2aₙ²+...)
  sin πz = πz Πₙ₌₁^∞ (1-z²/n²)  (famous example)

Entire functions:
  Liouville: bounded entire → constant
  Picard's little theorem: non-constant entire takes every value except at most one
  e^z misses 0; e^(e^z) doesn't miss any value

Gamma function:
  Γ(z) = ∫₀^∞ t^(z-1)e^(-t)dt  for Re(z)>0
  Meromorphic continuation to all z ≠ 0,-1,-2,...
  Γ(n+1) = n! (factorial generalization)
  Reflection formula: Γ(z)Γ(1-z) = π/sin(πz)
  Stirling: Γ(n+1) ~ √(2πn)(n/e)ⁿ

Argument principle:
  f meromorphic, γ simple closed curve:
  (1/2πi)∮_γ f'/f dz = Z - P  (zeros minus poles inside, with multiplicity)
  Rouché's theorem: |g|<|f| on γ → f and f+g have same number of zeros inside
```

        }
    }
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Real differentiable = complex differentiable | Complex differentiability requires CR equations (much stronger) |
| Log z is single-valued | log z is multi-valued; use principal branch Log z carefully |
| Cauchy theorem applies anywhere | Requires holomorphic function in simply connected region |
| Residue = whole Laurent series | Residue is ONLY the c₋₁ coefficient |
| Semicircle integral always vanishes | Need Jordan's lemma conditions; check |f(z)|→0 on arc |
| Conformal = angle preserving only | Also requires bijection and holomorphicity |
