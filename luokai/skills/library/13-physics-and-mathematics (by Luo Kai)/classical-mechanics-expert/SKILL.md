## Kinematics

### 1D Motion
```
Position:     x(t)
Velocity:     v(t) = dx/dt
Acceleration: a(t) = dv/dt = d²x/dt²

Constant acceleration equations:
  v = v₀ + at
  x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at²
  v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀)
  x = x₀ + ½(v₀ + v)t

Free fall (a = -g = -9.81 m/s²):
  v = v₀ - gt
  y = y₀ + v₀t - ½gt²
  v² = v₀² - 2g(y - y₀)
```

### 2D Projectile Motion
```
Horizontal:  x = v₀cosθ · t        vx = v₀cosθ (constant)
Vertical:    y = v₀sinθ · t - ½gt²  vy = v₀sinθ - gt

Range:       R = v₀²sin2θ / g
Max height:  H = v₀²sin²θ / 2g
Time of flight: T = 2v₀sinθ / g
Max range at θ = 45°
```

### Circular Motion
```
Angular velocity:     ω = dθ/dt = v/r
Angular acceleration: α = dω/dt
Centripetal acc:      ac = v²/r = ω²r  (toward center)
Tangential acc:       at = rα
Period:               T = 2π/ω = 2πr/v
```

---

## Newton's Laws
```
First Law:   An object remains at rest or uniform motion
             unless acted upon by a net external force.
             ΣF = 0 ↔ a = 0

Second Law:  ΣF = ma
             F = dp/dt (more general form)

Third Law:   For every action there is an equal and
             opposite reaction.
             F₁₂ = -F₂₁
```

### Common Forces
```
Weight:           W = mg (downward)
Normal force:     N (perpendicular to surface)
Friction:
  Static:         fs ≤ μsN (opposes impending motion)
  Kinetic:        fk = μkN (opposes motion, μk < μs)
Spring (Hooke):   F = -kx (restoring force)
Drag:             F = -bv (linear) or F = -cv² (quadratic)
```

### Problem Solving Framework
```
1. Draw free body diagram (FBD)
2. Choose coordinate system
3. Identify all forces on object
4. Apply ΣFx = max and ΣFy = may
5. Solve system of equations
6. Check units and reasonableness
```

def mechanical_energy():
    """
    Work-Energy Theorem and Conservation of Energy
    """
    return {
        'Work':                  'W = F·d·cosθ = ∫F·dx',
        'Kinetic Energy':        'KE = ½mv²',

        'check':        round(abs(pe_initial - ke_final), 6)
    }
```

## Momentum & Collisions
```
Linear momentum:    p = mv
Impulse:            J = FΔt = Δp = m(vf - vi)
Conservation:       ΣPinitial = ΣPfinal (no external forces)

Elastic collision (KE conserved):
  m₁v₁i + m₂v₂i = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f
  ½m₁v₁i² + ½m₂v₂i² = ½m₁v₁f² + ½m₂v₂f²

  Solutions:
  v₁f = (m₁-m₂)v₁i + 2m₂v₂i / (m₁+m₂)
  v₂f = (m₂-m₁)v₂i + 2m₁v₁i / (m₁+m₂)

Perfectly inelastic (stick together):
  v_final = (m₁v₁i + m₂v₂i) / (m₁+m₂)

Coefficient of restitution:
  e = relative speed after / relative speed before
  e = 1: elastic, e = 0: perfectly inelastic
```

## Rotational Dynamics
```
Angular quantities (analogous to linear):
  θ ↔ x      (angle ↔ position)
  ω ↔ v      (angular velocity ↔ velocity)
  α ↔ a      (angular acceleration ↔ acceleration)
  I ↔ m      (moment of inertia ↔ mass)
  τ ↔ F      (torque ↔ force)
  L ↔ p      (angular momentum ↔ momentum)

Torque:             τ = r × F = rFsinθ
Newton's 2nd (rot): τnet = Iα
Angular momentum:   L = Iω = r × p
Conservation of L:  L = constant if τnet = 0
Rotational KE:      KE_rot = ½Iω²
Rolling (no slip):  v_cm = rω, a_cm = rα

Moment of Inertia:
  Point mass:       I = mr²
  Solid sphere:     I = 2/5 mr²
  Hollow sphere:    I = 2/3 mr²
  Solid cylinder:   I = 1/2 mr²
  Hollow cylinder:  I = mr²
  Rod (center):     I = 1/12 mL²
  Rod (end):        I = 1/3 mL²

Parallel axis theorem: I = Icm + md²
```

## Oscillations
```
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):
  Restoring force:  F = -kx
  Equation:         ẍ + ω²x = 0
  Solution:         x(t) = A·cos(ωt + φ)
  Angular freq:     ω = √(k/m)
  Period:           T = 2π/ω = 2π√(m/k)
  Frequency:        f = 1/T = ω/2π
  Velocity:         v(t) = -Aω·sin(ωt + φ)
  Acceleration:     a(t) = -Aω²·cos(ωt + φ)
  Energy:           E = ½kA² = ½mv²_max

Simple Pendulum (small angles):
  ω = √(g/L)
  T = 2π√(L/g)

Physical Pendulum:
  T = 2π√(I/mgd)

Damped Oscillation:
  ẍ + 2βẋ + ω₀²x = 0
  Underdamped (β < ω₀): oscillates with decaying amplitude
  Critically damped (β = ω₀): fastest return to equilibrium
  Overdamped (β > ω₀): exponential decay, no oscillation

Driven Oscillation & Resonance:
  ẍ + 2βẋ + ω₀²x = F₀cosωt
  Resonance at: ω ≈ ω₀ (maximum amplitude)
  Quality factor: Q = ω₀/2β
```

---

## Gravitation
```
Newton's Law:       F = Gm₁m₂/r²   (G = 6.674×10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²)
Gravitational PE:   U = -Gm₁m₂/r
Escape velocity:    vesc = √(2GM/R)
Orbital velocity:   vorb = √(GM/r)
Orbital period:     T² = (4π²/GM)r³

Kepler's Laws:
  1st: Planets orbit in ellipses with Sun at one focus
  2nd: Equal areas swept in equal times (L conserved)
  3rd: T² ∝ a³  (a = semi-major axis)

Gravitational field: g = GM/r² (points toward mass)
Surface gravity:     g = GM/R² = 9.81 m/s² (Earth)

Shell theorem:
  Outside shell: acts as point mass at center
  Inside shell:  zero gravitational force
```

## Lagrangian Mechanics
```
Generalized coordinates: q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ
Lagrangian:     L = T - V  (kinetic - potential energy)

Euler-Lagrange equation:
  d/dt(∂L/∂q̇ᵢ) - ∂L/∂qᵢ = 0  for each coordinate i

Generalized momentum: pᵢ = ∂L/∂q̇ᵢ
Cyclic coordinate:    if ∂L/∂qᵢ = 0 → pᵢ = constant

Example — Simple Pendulum:
  q = θ (angle from vertical)
  T = ½mL²θ̇²
  V = mgL(1 - cosθ)
  L = ½mL²θ̇² - mgL(1 - cosθ)

  Euler-Lagrange:
  mL²θ̈ + mgLsinθ = 0
  θ̈ + (g/L)sinθ = 0  ✓ (matches Newton's result)

Advantages over Newton:
  - No need to find constraint forces
  - Works in any coordinate system
  - Systematic for complex systems
  - Direct path to conservation laws (Noether's theorem)
```

---

## Hamiltonian Mechanics
```
Hamiltonian:    H = Σpᵢq̇ᵢ - L = T + V (total energy)

Hamilton's equations:
  q̇ᵢ = +∂H/∂pᵢ
  ṗᵢ = -∂H/∂qᵢ

Phase space: (q, p) — 2n dimensional space
Phase space trajectory: governed by Hamilton's equations

Poisson bracket:
  {A, B} = Σᵢ(∂A/∂qᵢ · ∂B/∂pᵢ - ∂A/∂pᵢ · ∂B/∂qᵢ)
  {qᵢ, pⱼ} = δᵢⱼ
  {H, A} = 0 → A is conserved

Liouville's theorem:
  Phase space volume is conserved under Hamiltonian flow
  dρ/dt = 0 (ρ = phase space density)

Connection to quantum mechanics:
  Poisson brackets → Commutators: {A,B} → [Â,B̂]/iℏ
```

G = 6.674×10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²

```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Forgetting normal force direction | Always perpendicular to surface |
| Wrong sign on PE | Define reference point clearly, be consistent |
| Confusing mass and weight | W = mg, mass is scalar, weight is force |
| Forgetting rotational KE in rolling | KE_total = ½mv² + ½Iω² |
| Small angle approximation | sinθ ≈ θ only valid for θ < 15° |
| Inertial vs non-inertial frames | Add pseudo-forces in accelerating frames |
