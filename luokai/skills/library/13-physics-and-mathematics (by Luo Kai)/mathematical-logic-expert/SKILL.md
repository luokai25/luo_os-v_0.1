## Propositional Logic
```
Syntax:
  Atomic propositions: p, q, r, ...
  Connectives: ¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔
  Formation rules: if φ,ψ formulas then ¬φ, φ∧ψ, φ∨ψ, φ→ψ, φ↔ψ formulas

Semantics:
  Valuation: v: Prop → {T,F}
  Truth conditions:
    v(¬φ) = T iff v(φ) = F
    v(φ∧ψ) = T iff v(φ)=T and v(ψ)=T
    v(φ∨ψ) = T iff v(φ)=T or v(ψ)=T
    v(φ→ψ) = T iff v(φ)=F or v(ψ)=T
    v(φ↔ψ) = T iff v(φ)=v(ψ)

Satisfiability and validity:
  φ satisfiable: ∃v: v(φ)=T
  φ valid (tautology): ∀v: v(φ)=T  (written ⊨φ)
  φ,ψ logically equivalent: φ⊨ψ and ψ⊨φ  (same truth tables)
  Γ⊨φ: semantic entailment (φ true in all models of Γ)

Normal forms:
  CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form): ∧ of (∨ of literals)
  DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form): ∨ of (∧ of literals)
  Every formula has equivalent CNF and DNF
  Conversion: distribute ∧ over ∨ (CNF) or ∨ over ∧ (DNF)

Resolution:
  Rule: (A∨p) ∧ (B∨¬p) → A∨B  (resolvent)
  Resolution refutation: derive ⊥ (empty clause) from Γ∪{¬φ}
  Completeness: Γ⊨φ iff resolution derives ⊥ from Γ∪{¬φ}
  DPLL algorithm: efficient SAT solving with backtracking
```

---

## First-Order Logic
```
Signature: constants c, function symbols f, predicate symbols P
  Arity: number of arguments

Terms:
  Variables x,y,z,... are terms
  If f is n-ary and t₁,...,tₙ are terms: f(t₁,...,tₙ) is a term
  Constants: 0-ary function symbols

Atomic formulas: P(t₁,...,tₙ) for n-ary P, terms tᵢ
  Equality: t₁ = t₂

Formulas:
  Atomic formulas
  ¬φ, φ∧ψ, φ∨ψ, φ→ψ, φ↔ψ
  ∀xφ, ∃xφ  (x bound in φ)

Free and bound variables:
  x free in φ: x occurs unbound
  Sentence: formula with no free variables
  Substitution: φ[t/x] = φ with t replacing free x (avoid capture)

Interpretations/Structures:
  M = (D, Iₜ, Iₚ)
  D: nonempty domain (universe)
  Iₜ: interprets terms (constants → elements, functions → functions on D)
  Iₚ: interprets predicates (n-ary predicates → subsets of Dⁿ)

Satisfaction M⊨φ[s] (s = variable assignment):
  M⊨P(t₁,...,tₙ)[s]: (⟦t₁⟧ₛ,...,⟦tₙ⟧ₛ) ∈ Iₚ(P)
  M⊨¬φ[s]: M⊭φ[s]
  M⊨∀xφ[s]: for all d∈D, M⊨φ[s(x↦d)]
  M⊨∃xφ[s]: there exists d∈D, M⊨φ[s(x↦d)]

Logical consequence: Γ⊨φ  (φ true in all models of Γ)
Theory: set of sentences closed under logical consequence
```

## Proof Theory

### Natural Deduction
```
Introduction/elimination rules for each connective:

∧-intro: from φ,ψ derive φ∧ψ
∧-elim: from φ∧ψ derive φ (or ψ)

∨-intro: from φ derive φ∨ψ (or ψ∨φ)
∨-elim: from φ∨ψ, (φ→χ), (ψ→χ) derive χ

→-intro: from [φ]...ψ derive φ→ψ  (discharge assumption φ)
→-elim: from φ→ψ, φ derive ψ  (modus ponens)

¬-intro: from [φ]...⊥ derive ¬φ  (reductio)
¬-elim: from ¬φ,φ derive ⊥
¬¬-elim: from ¬¬φ derive φ  (classical logic)

∀-intro: from φ derive ∀xφ  (x not free in assumptions)
∀-elim: from ∀xφ derive φ[t/x]

∃-intro: from φ[t/x] derive ∃xφ
∃-elim: from ∃xφ, (from [φ]...ψ) derive ψ  (x not in ψ or assumptions)

Sequent calculus (Gentzen):
  Γ⊢Δ: from assumptions Γ can derive some formula in Δ
  Cut rule: Γ⊢Δ,φ  and  φ,Γ⊢Δ  → Γ⊢Δ
  Cut elimination: every proof can be transformed to cut-free proof
```

### Hilbert System
```
Axioms (for classical propositional logic):
  (K): φ→(ψ→φ)
  (S): (φ→(ψ→χ))→((φ→ψ)→(φ→χ))
  (DNE): ¬¬φ→φ

Modus ponens: from φ→ψ and φ derive ψ

Deduction theorem: Γ,φ⊢ψ iff Γ⊢φ→ψ

Soundness: Γ⊢φ → Γ⊨φ  (provable things are true)
Completeness: Γ⊨φ → Γ⊢φ  (true things are provable)
  Propositional: decidable (truth tables)
  First-order: Godel completeness theorem (1929)
```

---

## Model Theory
```
Godel Completeness Theorem:
  Γ⊨φ iff Γ⊢φ  (for first-order logic)
  If Γ is consistent → Γ has a model
  Proof: Henkin construction — build model from maximal consistent set

Lowenheim-Skolem theorems:
  Downward: if T has model of size κ ≥ |T|, has countable model
  Upward: if T has infinite model, has models of every infinite cardinality
  Consequence: no first-order characterization of ℝ (has countable models)
    Nonstandard models of arithmetic, analysis!

Compactness theorem:
  Γ has model iff every finite Γ₀⊆Γ has model
  Proof: from completeness (finite derivations use finitely many hypotheses)
  Applications:
    Nonstandard analysis (add axioms ∃x>n for each n)
    Graph coloring (infinite graphs from finite)
    Transfer principles

Elementary equivalence:
  M≡N: M,N satisfy same sentences  (can't distinguish by FOL)
  ℝ and nonstandard reals are elementarily equivalent!
  Isomorphic → elementary equivalent (converse fails in general)

Types and omitting types:
  Type of tuple ā in M: {φ(x̄): M⊨φ(ā)}
  Omitting types theorem: can build models omitting non-principal types
  Saturated models: realize all types

Quantifier elimination:
  Theory T admits QE: every formula ≡ quantifier-free formula (mod T)
  Examples: dense linear orders (DLO), real closed fields (Tarski)
  Decidability: if T has QE and decidable QF theory → T decidable

Model theoretic algebra:
  Algebraically closed fields: complete, QE in ring language
  Real closed fields: complete, QE (Tarski's theorem)
  Dense linear orders: complete, QE

Stability theory:
  κ-stable: T has ≤κ types over every set of size κ
  ω-stable, superstable, stable, NIP, simple theories (classification)
  Morley categoricity: T categorical in some uncountable κ → categorical in all
```

---

## Set Theory
```
Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms (ZFC):
  1. Extensionality: sets equal iff same elements
  2. Empty set: ∃∅: ∀x(x∉∅)
  3. Pairing: ∃z: z={x,y} for any x,y
  4. Union: ∃z: z=∪A for any set A
  5. Power set: ∃z: z=P(A) for any set A
  6. Separation: {x∈A: φ(x)} is a set
  7. Replacement: image of set under function is a set
  8. Infinity: ∃ω: ∅∈ω and x∈ω→x∪{x}∈ω
  9. Foundation: every nonempty set has ∈-minimal element
  C. Choice: every family of nonempty sets has choice function

Ordinals:
  Defined as hereditary transitive sets well-ordered by ∈
  0=∅, 1={∅}, 2={∅,{∅}}, 3=2∪{2}, ...
  ω = {0,1,2,...} = natural numbers
  ω+1 = ω∪{ω}, ω·2, ω², ωω, ε₀,...
  Every well-ordered set isomorphic to unique ordinal (Zermelo)

Cardinals:
  |A| = |B|: bijection exists
  Alephs: ℵ₀ = |ℕ|, ℵ₁ = next, ℵ₂, ... (infinite cardinals)
  Continuum: |ℝ| = 2^ℵ₀ = c
  Continuum Hypothesis: 2^ℵ₀ = ℵ₁ (independent of ZFC!)
  König's theorem: cf(κ) > cf(λ) → κ^λ > κ

Axiom of Choice equivalents:
  Zorn's lemma: every chain-complete poset has maximal element
  Well-ordering: every set can be well-ordered
  Tychonoff: product of compact spaces is compact
  All vector spaces have basis
  Every surjection has right inverse

Forcing:
  Cohen's technique to build new set-theoretic universes
  Proves independence of CH from ZFC (1963)
  Add generic sets via partial orders (forcing posets)
  P-names, generic filters, truth in forcing extensions

## Godel's Incompleteness Theorems
```
Setup:
  Formal system T: recursive set of axioms, rules of inference
  Sufficiently powerful: can express basic arithmetic (PA or stronger)
  Consistent: cannot prove both φ and ¬φ

First Incompleteness Theorem:
  If T is consistent and sufficiently powerful:
  ∃ sentence φ: T⊬φ and T⊬¬φ  (T is incomplete)
  φ is "true but unprovable" (assuming T is sound)

Proof sketch (Godel 1931):
  Arithmetization: encode formulas as numbers (Godel numbering)
  Representability: provability is expressible in arithmetic
  Self-reference: Diagonal lemma: ∃φ ↔ ¬Provₜ(⌈φ⌉)
    "This statement is not provable in T"
  If T proves φ → T proves Provₜ(φ) → T proves ¬φ → inconsistent
  If T proves ¬φ → T proves Provₜ(φ) is false → contradicts Provₜ being correct
  Therefore T proves neither → incomplete ✓

Second Incompleteness Theorem:
  If T is consistent and sufficiently powerful:
  T⊬Con(T)  (T cannot prove its own consistency)
  Con(T) = "T is consistent" = ¬Provₜ(⌈⊥⌉)
  Consequence: cannot prove safety of formal systems within themselves

Scope and limitations:
  Applies to: PA, ZFC, any sufficiently strong consistent theory
  Doesn't apply to: Presburger arithmetic (addition only), real arithmetic
  Not mystical: about formal provability, not mathematical truth
  Godel sentence φ IS true (in ℕ) if T is sound — just not formally provable in T

Implications:
  Hilbert's program: impossible — cannot finitely axiomatize mathematics with proof of consistency
  Truth ≠ provability in formal systems
  Some mathematical questions genuinely independent of ZFC (CH, large cardinals)
```

---

## Type Theory
```
Simple Type Theory:
  Types: base types (Bool, Nat), function types (A→B), product types (A×B)
  Terms: variables x:A, λx:A.t:B (function), t u (application)
  Typing rules: Γ,x:A ⊢ t:B implies Γ ⊢ λx:A.t : A→B

Curry-Howard Correspondence:
  Types ↔ Propositions
  Terms ↔ Proofs
  A→B ↔ "A implies B"
  A×B ↔ "A and B"
  A+B ↔ "A or B"
  ⊥ ↔ False (empty type)
  ∀x:A.B(x) ↔ "For all x:A, B(x)" (dependent product)
  ∃x:A.B(x) ↔ "There exists x:A, B(x)" (dependent sum)

Dependent type theory:
  Types can depend on terms
  Π-types: Πx:A.B(x) — dependent function type
  Σ-types: Σx:A.B(x) — dependent pair type
  Identity types: Id_A(a,b) — proof that a=b:A

Martin-Löf Type Theory (MLTT):
  Foundation for constructive mathematics and type theory
  Universes: type of types
  W-types: well-founded trees

Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT):
  Identity types as paths in topological space
  Univalence axiom: equivalent types are equal
  Higher inductive types
  Foundations without classical logic

Proof assistants:
  Coq: CIC (Calculus of Inductive Constructions)
  Lean 4: dependent type theory, Mathlib (huge math library)
  Agda: Martin-Löf type theory, homotopy type theory
  Isabelle: HOL (Higher Order Logic)
  Applications: verified software, formalized mathematics

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Incompleteness means math is broken | It limits formal provability, not mathematical truth |
| FOL can characterize ℝ uniquely | By Lowenheim-Skolem: FOL theories have models of all infinite cardinalities |
| Undecidable = not solvable in practice | Undecidable = no algorithm for ALL instances; specific instances may be solved |
| Godel's sentence is unprovable AND false | It's TRUE (in ℕ) but unprovable in T — truth ≠ formal provability |
| ZFC is inconsistent | No known inconsistency; we believe it's consistent but cannot prove it in ZFC |
| Type theory is just programming types | Dependent type theory is a foundation for mathematics, much richer |
