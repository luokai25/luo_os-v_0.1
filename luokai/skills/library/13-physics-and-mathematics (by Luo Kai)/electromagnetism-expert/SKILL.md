## Electrostatics

### Coulomb's Law & Electric Field
```
Coulomb's Law:
  F = kq₁q₂/r²  r̂   (k = 1/4πε₀ = 8.99×10⁹ N·m²/C²)
  ε₀ = 8.85×10⁻¹² C²/N·m² (permittivity of free space)

Electric Field:
  E = F/q = kq/r² r̂  (due to point charge q)
  F = qE            (force on charge q in field E)
  Superposition: E_total = ΣEᵢ (vector sum)

Electric field lines:
  Start on + charges, end on - charges
  Denser lines = stronger field
  Never cross
```

### Gauss's Law
```
Integral form:
  ∮E·dA = Q_enc/ε₀

Differential form:
  ∇·E = ρ/ε₀   (ρ = charge density)

Applications (use symmetry):
  Sphere of charge Q, r > R:  E = kQ/r²  (same as point charge)
  Infinite line charge λ:      E = λ/2πε₀r
  Infinite plane charge σ:     E = σ/2ε₀
  Inside conductor:            E = 0
```

### Electric Potential
```
Potential:      V = kq/r  (point charge)
                E = -∇V
                V = -∫E·dl

Potential energy: U = qV = kq₁q₂/r

Equipotential surfaces: perpendicular to E field lines

Poisson's equation:   ∇²V = -ρ/ε₀
Laplace's equation:   ∇²V = 0  (charge-free region)

Capacitance:
  C = Q/V
  Parallel plate: C = ε₀A/d
  Spherical:      C = 4πε₀R
  Energy stored:  U = ½CV² = Q²/2C = ½QV
```

## Magnetostatics

### Magnetic Force & Field
```
Lorentz Force:
  F = q(E + v×B)
  Magnetic force: F = qv×B
  On current:     F = IL×B

Biot-Savart Law:
  dB = (μ₀/4π) · I·dl×r̂/r²
  B due to long wire: B = μ₀I/2πr  (circular field lines)
  B at center of loop: B = μ₀I/2R

μ₀ = 4π×10⁻⁷ T·m/A (permeability of free space)

Magnetic dipole moment:
  m = IA n̂  (current loop)
  Torque: τ = m×B
  Energy: U = -m·B
```

### Ampere's Law
```
Integral form:
  ∮B·dl = μ₀I_enc  (magnetostatics)
  ∮B·dl = μ₀(I_enc + ε₀dΦE/dt)  (with displacement current)

Differential form:
  ∇×B = μ₀J  (static)
  ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t  (general)

Applications:
  Infinite solenoid: B = μ₀nI  (n = turns/length, inside)
  Toroid:           B = μ₀NI/2πr
  Outside solenoid: B = 0
```

## Electromagnetic Induction
```
Faraday's Law:
  EMF = -dΦB/dt
  ΦB = ∫B·dA  (magnetic flux)
  ∮E·dl = -dΦB/dt

Differential form:
  ∇×E = -∂B/∂t

Lenz's Law:
  Induced current opposes change in flux
  (negative sign in Faraday's law)

Motional EMF:
  EMF = BLv  (rod of length L moving at v in field B)

Self-Inductance:
  L = NΦB/I  (Henry)
  EMF = -L·dI/dt
  Energy: U = ½LI²

Solenoid inductance: L = μ₀N²A/ℓ

Mutual Inductance:
  EMF₂ = -M·dI₁/dt
  M = μ₀N₁N₂A/ℓ  (for coaxial solenoids)
```

## Maxwell's Equations
```
Complete set (SI units):

1. Gauss's Law (Electric):
   ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
   ∮E·dA = Q_enc/ε₀

2. Gauss's Law (Magnetic):
   ∇·B = 0   (no magnetic monopoles)
   ∮B·dA = 0

3. Faraday's Law:
   ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
   ∮E·dl = -dΦB/dt

4. Ampere-Maxwell Law:
   ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t
   ∮B·dl = μ₀(I_enc + ε₀dΦE/dt)

In vacuum (ρ=0, J=0):
   ∇·E = 0       ∇·B = 0
   ∇×E = -∂B/∂t  ∇×B = μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t
```

### Wave Equation Derivation
```
Take curl of Faraday: ∇×(∇×E) = -∂(∇×B)/∂t
Use vector identity:  ∇(∇·E) - ∇²E = -μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t²
With ∇·E = 0:        ∇²E = μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t²

Wave equation:  ∇²E = (1/c²)∂²E/∂t²
Speed of light: c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) = 3×10⁸ m/s  ✓

Gradient:    ∇f = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z)
Divergence:  ∇·F = ∂Fx/∂x + ∂Fy/∂y + ∂Fz/∂z
Curl:        ∇×F = (∂Fz/∂y-∂Fy/∂z, ∂Fx/∂z-∂Fz/∂x, ∂Fy/∂x-∂Fx/∂y)

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Wrong direction of B from wire | Use right-hand rule consistently |
| Forgetting displacement current | Include ε₀∂E/∂t in Ampere's law |
| Confusing E and V | E = -∇V, they have different units |
| Sign error in Faraday's law | Lenz's law: induced EMF opposes change |
| Forgetting ∇·B = 0 | No magnetic monopoles — B field lines always close |
| Units confusion | Check SI units carefully in every equation |
