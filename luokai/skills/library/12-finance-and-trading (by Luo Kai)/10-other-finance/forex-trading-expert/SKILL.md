## Forex Market Structure

### Currency Pair Categories
    Majors (USD paired with major economies):
      EUR/USD  ->  Euro / US Dollar        (most liquid pair)
      GBP/USD  ->  British Pound / Dollar  (the "Cable")
      USD/JPY  ->  Dollar / Japanese Yen   (risk sentiment proxy)
      USD/CHF  ->  Dollar / Swiss Franc    (safe haven pair)
      AUD/USD  ->  Australian Dollar / USD (commodity proxy)
      NZD/USD  ->  New Zealand Dollar / USD
      USD/CAD  ->  Dollar / Canadian Dollar (oil proxy)

    Minors (cross pairs, no USD):
      EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY (the "Dragon")
      Higher spreads than majors, good volatility

    Exotics (major + emerging market):
      USD/TRY, USD/ZAR, USD/MXN
      Very high spreads, low liquidity, high risk

      EUR/USD and GBP/USD  ->  +0.85 correlation
      AUD/USD and NZD/USD  ->  +0.90 correlation
      EUR/USD and AUD/USD  ->  +0.70 correlation

    Negative Correlations (move opposite):
      EUR/USD and USD/CHF  ->  -0.90 correlation
      EUR/USD and USD/JPY  ->  -0.50 correlation (varies)

## Pip & Lot Calculations
```python
def pip_value(pair, lot_size, account_currency='USD'):
    """
    Calculate pip value for standard, mini, and micro lots.
    Standard lot = 100,000 units
    Mini lot     = 10,000 units
    Micro lot    = 1,000 units
    """
    lot_units = {
        'standard': 100_000,
        'mini':      10_000,
        'micro':      1_000
    }

    units = lot_units.get(lot_size, lot_size)

    # For pairs where USD is quote currency (EUR/USD, GBP/USD)
    if pair.endswith('USD'):
        pip_val = units * 0.0001  # = $10 per standard lot
        return round(pip_val, 2)

    # For pairs where USD is base currency (USD/JPY, USD/CAD)
    # Need current price to convert
    return f"Divide {units * 0.0001} by current {pair} price"

def position_size(account_balance, risk_percent, stop_loss_pips, pip_value_per_lot):
    """
    Calculate position size based on risk management.
    """
    risk_amount    = account_balance * risk_percent
    lots           = risk_amount / (stop_loss_pips * pip_value_per_lot)
    return round(lots, 2)

def leverage_exposure(lots, price, leverage):
    """
    Calculate actual market exposure with leverage.
    """
    notional  = lots * 100_000 * price
    margin    = notional / leverage
    return {
        'notional_value': round(notional, 2),
        'required_margin': round(margin, 2),
        'exposure_ratio':  leverage
    }

def pips_to_dollars(pips, lots, pair):
    """Convert pip gain/loss to dollar P&L."""
    if pair.endswith('USD'):
        return round(pips * 10 * lots, 2)  # $10 per pip per standard lot
    else:
        return f"Convert using current {pair[-3:]} rate"

# Example: 1% risk on $10,000 account, 50 pip stop, EUR/USD
account   = 10_000
risk      = 0.01        # 1%
stop_pips = 50

lots = position_size(account, risk, stop_pips, pip_val)
print(f"Trade {lots} lots = risk ${account * risk}")
```

## Macroeconomics & Central Banks

### Interest Rate Impact
    Higher rates  ->  Currency strengthens (attract foreign capital)
    Lower rates   ->  Currency weakens (capital flows elsewhere)
    Rate hike cycle:
      Central bank signals hikes -> currency rallies in anticipation
      First hike announced       -> often "buy the rumor, sell the news"
      Hiking cycle peaks         -> look for reversal as growth slows

### Central Bank Hierarchy
```python
central_banks = {
    'Fed':  {
        'currency': 'USD',
        'meeting':  '8x per year (FOMC)',
        'tools':    ['Fed Funds Rate', 'QE/QT', 'Forward Guidance'],
        'impact':   'Highest global impact - USD is reserve currency'
    },
    'ECB':  {
        'currency': 'EUR',
        'meeting':  '8x per year',
        'tools':    ['Deposit Rate', 'TLTRO', 'Asset Purchases'],
        'impact':   'Second largest impact'
    },
    'BOJ':  {
        'currency': 'JPY',
        'meeting':  '8x per year',
        'tools':    ['Policy Rate', 'YCC', 'ETF Purchases'],
        'impact':   'Yield Curve Control unique policy - watch for surprises'
    },
    'BOE':  {
        'currency': 'GBP',
        'meeting':  '8x per year (MPC)',
        'tools':    ['Bank Rate', 'QE'],
        'impact':   'High impact on GBP pairs'
    },
    'SNB':  {
        'currency': 'CHF',
        'meeting':  'Quarterly',
        'tools':    ['Policy Rate', 'FX Intervention'],
        'impact':   'Known for surprise interventions to weaken CHF'
    },
    'RBA':  {
        'currency': 'AUD',
        'meeting':  '11x per year',
        'tools':    ['Cash Rate Target'],
        'impact':   'Commodity-linked, China exposure'
    }
}
```

### Key Economic Indicators
    United States (highest market impact):
      NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls):
        Release:  First Friday of each month
        Impact:   MASSIVE - can move USD pairs 100+ pips instantly
        Watch:    Actual vs forecast, revision of prior month

      CPI (Consumer Price Index):
        Release:  Monthly, ~2 weeks after month end
        Impact:   Very high - drives Fed rate expectations
        Watch:    Core CPI (ex food/energy) most important

      FOMC Decision:
        Release:  8x per year, Wednesday 14:00 ET
        Impact:   Highest single event for USD
        Watch:    Rate decision + statement + press conference

      GDP:
        Release:  Quarterly (advance, preliminary, final)
        Impact:   Medium - markets anticipate it

      Retail Sales:
        Release:  Monthly
        Impact:   Medium-high - consumer spending proxy

    Interpreting Releases:
      Actual > Forecast  ->  Currency strengthens (beat expectations)
      Actual < Forecast  ->  Currency weakens (missed expectations)
      Revision matters:  Prior month revision can move markets too

## Carry Trade Strategy
```python
def carry_trade_analysis(pairs_data):
    """
    Find best carry trade opportunities based on interest rate differentials.
    Carry trade: borrow low-rate currency, invest in high-rate currency.
    """
    opportunities = []

    for pair, data in pairs_data.items():
        base_rate  = data['base_currency_rate']
        quote_rate = data['quote_currency_rate']
        differential = base_rate - quote_rate

        # Daily carry income (approximate)
        daily_carry = (differential / 365) * data['notional']

        opportunities.append({
            'pair':         pair,
            'differential': round(differential, 4),
            'daily_carry':  round(daily_carry, 2),
            'annual_carry': round(daily_carry * 365, 2),
            'risk':         data.get('volatility', 'unknown')
        })

    return sorted(opportunities, key=lambda x: x['differential'], reverse=True)

# Classic carry trades (historically):
# Long AUD/JPY: AUD high rates vs JPY near-zero rates
# Long NZD/JPY: similar dynamic
# Long USD/JPY: when Fed rates > BOJ rates

# Carry trade risks:
# Sudden risk-off event = carry unwind = JPY/CHF spike
# Black swan = carry pairs crash violently
# Rule: reduce carry exposure in high VIX environments
```

## Forex Technical Analysis

### Key Levels to Watch
    Round numbers:        1.1000, 1.2000, 150.00 (psychological magnets)
    Daily open:           Price often returns to daily open
    Weekly open:          Strong bias level for the week
    Previous day H/L:     Key intraday support/resistance
    Monthly open/close:   Long-term bias levels

### Forex-Specific Patterns
    London Breakout:
      Asian session forms tight range
      London open breaks above/below range
      Trade breakout with stop at opposite side of range
      Target: 2x range height

    Judas Swing (Smart Money):
      Price fakes break of Asian high/low at London open
      Reverses sharply in opposite direction
      Entry: after reversal candle confirms fake-out

    Daily Bias Method:
      Check if price is above/below daily open
      Above daily open: look for longs on pullbacks
      Below daily open: look for shorts on rallies

## News Trading

### High Impact Events Calendar
    Event          Frequency    Typical Pip Move (EUR/USD)
    NFP            Monthly      50-150 pips
    FOMC Rate      8x/year      80-200 pips
    CPI            Monthly      40-100 pips
    ECB Rate       8x/year      60-150 pips
    GDP            Quarterly    20-50 pips
    Retail Sales   Monthly      20-40 pips

### News Trading Rules
    - Check economic calendar EVERY day before trading
    - Widen stops or close positions 15 min before high impact news
    - Spreads widen massively during news — factor into P&L
    - Straddle strategy: place buy stop above and sell stop below pre-news range
    - Wait for initial spike + retest before entering directionally

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Over-leveraging | 100:1 leverage, small move = wipeout | Max 10:1 effective leverage |
| Trading all sessions | Chasing moves in thin markets | Stick to London/NY overlap |
| Ignoring news calendar | Blown stop on surprise data | Check calendar every morning |
| Fighting central bank | Shorting currency in hike cycle | Trade WITH monetary policy trend |
| Overtrading exotic pairs | Huge spreads eat profits | Stick to majors and liquid minors |
| No stop loss on news | Gap through stop, massive loss | Always use stop loss orders |
| Ignoring correlations | Double exposure unknowingly | Check correlation before adding pairs |

---

## Best Practices

- **Trade WITH the trend of the higher timeframe** — daily trend is your friend
- **Know the news calendar** — check it every single trading day
- **Respect central bank policy** — do not fight the Fed or BOJ
- **Session awareness** — trade the most liquid session for your pair
- **Risk 1% per trade maximum** — forex leverage makes this critical
- **Keep a trade log** — note entry reason, news context, outcome
- **Backtest your setups** — especially London breakout and news fades
