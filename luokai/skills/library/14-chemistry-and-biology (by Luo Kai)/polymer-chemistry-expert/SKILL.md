## Polymerization Mechanisms

### Chain-Growth (Addition) Polymerization
```
Mechanism: monomer adds to active chain end
Steps: initiation → propagation → termination

Free radical polymerization:
  Initiation:   I → 2R•  (initiator decomposition)
                R• + M → RM•  (chain start)
  Propagation:  RM• + M → RM₂•  (fast, kp ~10³ L/mol·s)
  Termination:  Rt = 2kt[M•]²
                Combination: RM• + •MR → RMMR
                Disproportionation: RM• + •MR → RMH + RM=

  Rate of polymerization:
    Rp = kp[M][M•] = kp[M](Ri/2kt)^(1/2)
    Rp ∝ [M][I]^(1/2)  (first order in M, half order in I)

  Kinetic chain length:
    ν = Rp/Ri = kp[M]/(2kt·Ri)^(1/2)
    DP = ν (termination by disproportionation)
    DP = 2ν (termination by combination)

  Chain transfer:
    To monomer, solvent, initiator, polymer
    Reduces DP without changing Rp (usually)
    Cm = ktrM/kp (chain transfer constant to monomer)

Common monomers and polymers:
  Ethylene → polyethylene (PE)
  Styrene → polystyrene (PS)
  Methyl methacrylate → PMMA (plexiglass)
  Vinyl chloride → PVC
  Acrylonitrile → PAN (fiber precursor)
  Tetrafluoroethylene → PTFE (Teflon)
  Butadiene → polybutadiene (rubber)
```

### Ionic Polymerization
```
Anionic polymerization:
  Initiators: organolithium (n-BuLi), electron transfer (Na/naphthalene)
  Carbanion active center
  No termination (no combination of like charges)
  Living polymerization: Mn = [M]₀/[I]₀ × M_monomer
  Very narrow dispersity (Đ → 1.0)
  Block copolymers: add second monomer after first consumed
  Suitable monomers: styrene, dienes, methacrylates (e-withdrawing group)

Cationic polymerization:
  Initiators: Lewis acids (BF₃, AlCl₃) + co-initiator (H₂O, ROH)
  Carbocation active center
  Chain transfer common → lower MW
  Best at low temperature
  Suitable monomers: isobutylene, vinyl ethers, styrene
  Industrial: butyl rubber (isobutylene + isoprene)

Coordination polymerization (Ziegler-Natta):
  Catalysts: TiCl₄ + AlEt₃ (heterogeneous)
  Stereospecific: isotactic or syndiotactic PP, PE
  Metallocenes: homogeneous, well-defined stereocontrol
  HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE, isotactic PP (iPP)
```

### Step-Growth (Condensation) Polymerization
```
Both functional groups react, small molecule byproduct often released
Mechanism: A-A + B-B → A-AB-B → oligomers → polymer
  All species react: monomer, dimer, trimer, etc.
  High conversion needed for high MW: p = conversion
  Carothers equation: DPn = 1/(1-p)
  For high MW: need p > 0.99!

Molecular weight build-up:
  p = 0.9:  DPn = 10
  p = 0.99: DPn = 100
  p = 0.999: DPn = 1000

Important step-growth polymers:
  Polyesters: HO-R-OH + HOOC-R'-COOH → polyester + H₂O
    PET (polyethylene terephthalate): bottles, fibers
    PBT, polycarbonate (PC, Lexan)

  Polyamides (nylons):
    H₂N-R-NH₂ + HOOC-R'-COOH → polyamide + H₂O
    Nylon 6,6: hexamethylenediamine + adipic acid
    Nylon 6: ring-opening of caprolactam
    Kevlar: para-phenylene diamine + terephthaloyl chloride

  Polyurethanes:
    HO-R-OH + OCN-R'-NCO → polyurethane (no byproduct)
    Flexible foam, rigid foam, elastomers, coatings

  Epoxies:
    Epoxide + amine → crosslinked network (thermoset)
    High performance adhesives, composites

  Phenol-formaldehyde (Bakelite):
    Phenol + HCHO → branched/crosslinked network
    First synthetic polymer (1907)
```

## Living/Controlled Polymerization
```
Living polymerization:
  No termination, no chain transfer
  All chains grow simultaneously → narrow Đ
  Mn predictable from [M]/[I] ratio
  Block, star, gradient copolymers accessible

ATRP (Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization):
  Catalyst: Cu(I)/ligand (PMDETA, bpy)
  Initiator: alkyl halide (R-X)
  Equilibrium: R-X + Cu(I) ⇌ R• + Cu(II)-X
  kact/kdeact << 1 → radical concentration very low → no termination
  Đ = 1.05-1.3 typical
  Suitable: (meth)acrylates, styrene

RAFT (Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Transfer):
  Agent: dithioester, trithiocarbonate (chain transfer agent)
  Mechanism: degenerative transfer between dormant and active chains
  Đ → 1.1
  Wide monomer scope: acidic monomers, vinyl acetate possible
  No metal catalyst (advantage for biomedical)

Anionic living:
  Strictest living: Đ → 1.01
  Requires very pure conditions (moisture/O₂ kills carbanions)
  Block copolymers: styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS thermoplastic elastomer)

Ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP):
  Grubbs catalyst (Ru carbene)
  Strained cyclic alkenes: norbornene, cyclooctene
  Đ ~ 1.05-1.2, well-defined
```

```python
def molecular_weight_averages(molecular_weights, counts):
    """
    Calculate Mn, Mw, Mz and dispersity.
    molecular_weights: list of MW values
    counts: number of chains with each MW
    """
    import numpy as np
    Mi = np.array(molecular_weights)
    Ni = np.array(counts)

    Mn = np.sum(Ni * Mi) / np.sum(Ni)          # number average
    Mw = np.sum(Ni * Mi**2) / np.sum(Ni * Mi)  # weight average
    Mz = np.sum(Ni * Mi**3) / np.sum(Ni * Mi**2)  # z-average
    D  = Mw / Mn                                # dispersity (PDI)

    return {
        'Mn':          round(Mn, 0),
        'Mw':          round(Mw, 0),
        'Mz':          round(Mz, 0),
        'Dispersity':  round(D, 3),
        'note': 'Mn < Mw < Mz always; narrow distribution → Đ → 1'

    }
```

## Polymer Solutions
```
Flory-Huggins theory:
  ΔGmix/nRT = φ₁ln(φ₁) + (φ₂/x)ln(φ₂) + χ₁₂φ₁φ₂
  φ = volume fractions, x = degree of polymerization
  χ₁₂ = Flory-Huggins parameter (interaction parameter)
  χ < 0.5: miscible (good solvent for polymer)
  χ > 0.5: phase separation likely
  χ = 0.5 at theta (θ) temperature

Theta (θ) conditions:
  Second virial coefficient A₂ = 0
  Excluded volume effects cancel
  Chains behave as ideal (unperturbed)
  Used to measure unperturbed dimensions

Polymer chain dimensions:
  Random walk: ⟨r²⟩⁰ = nl²  (freely jointed chain)
  Real chain: ⟨r²⟩ = Cnl² (C∞ = characteristic ratio)
  Radius of gyration: Rg² = ⟨r²⟩/6 (Gaussian)
  Hydrodynamic radius: Rh (from DLS or viscometry)
  Good solvent: Rg ~ N^0.6, theta: Rg ~ N^0.5

Viscometry:
  Intrinsic viscosity: [η] = lim(c→0)(ηsp/c)
  Mark-Houwink: [η] = KMᵃ  (a=0.5-0.8 typical)
  Huggins: ηsp/c = [η] + kH[η]²c
  Kraemer: lnηrel/c = [η] - kK[η]²c
```

## Solid State Properties
```
Crystallinity:
  Semicrystalline polymers: crystalline regions + amorphous regions
  Degree of crystallinity: Xc = (ΔHf - ΔHcc)/ΔHf°
  Measured by: DSC, WAXS, density
  High crystallinity: HDPE, PTFE, PA66, POM
  Amorphous: PS, PMMA, PC, PVC (atactic)

Glass transition temperature (Tg):
  Amorphous regions: glassy ↔ rubbery
  Below Tg: rigid, brittle (glassy)
  Above Tg: soft, rubbery, mobile chains
  Measured by DSC (step change in Cp), DMA (peak in tan δ)
  Fox equation: 1/Tg = w₁/Tg₁ + w₂/Tg₂  (copolymers/blends)
  Factors: chain stiffness↑, bulky groups↑, crosslinks↑ → Tg↑
           plasticizers↓, flexible backbone↓ → Tg↓

Melting temperature (Tm):
  Crystalline melting (first order transition)
  Tm affected by: crystal perfection, MW, pressure
  Thomson-Gibbs: Tm = Tm°(1 - 2σe/ΔHf·lc)
  Tg/Tm ≈ 0.5-0.7 (Tg in Kelvin, rule of thumb)

Polymer morphology:
  Lamellae: folded chain crystals, ~10-20 nm thick
  Spherulites: radial lamellar growth, seen in polarized optical microscopy
  Tie molecules: connect crystalline regions
  Branching: disrupts crystallinity (LDPE vs HDPE)
```

## Mechanical Properties
```
Viscoelasticity:
  Polymers show both elastic (spring) and viscous (dashpot) behavior
  Time-temperature superposition: shift factor aT
  WLF equation: log(aT) = -C₁(T-Tref)/(C₂+T-Tref)
  Master curve: shift data at different T to single curve

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA):
  Storage modulus E′: elastic component
  Loss modulus E″: viscous component (energy dissipation)
  tan δ = E″/E′ (damping factor)
  Peak in tan δ: Tg, Tβ, Tγ transitions

Rubber elasticity:
  Entropy-driven (unlike metals, stress → less entropy)
  Stress: σ = NkT(λ - 1/λ²)  (uniaxial)
  N = crosslink density (chains/volume)
  Shear modulus: G = NkT = ρRT/Mc
  Mc = molecular weight between crosslinks

Stress-strain behavior:
  Glassy/brittle: high modulus, low elongation, sudden fracture
  Semicrystalline: yield point, cold drawing, high elongation
  Elastomers: large elongation, full recovery, low modulus
  E (modulus): GPa (glassy), MPa (rubber), 10-100 GPa (fiber)

Time-dependent behavior:
  Creep: constant stress → increasing strain over time
  Stress relaxation: constant strain → decreasing stress
  Boltzmann superposition: linear viscoelastic regime
```

## Copolymers
```
Copolymer types:
  Random/statistical: -AABABBA- (Mayo-Lewis equation)
  Alternating:        -ABABAB-  (r₁r₂ → 0)
  Block:              -AAAA-BBBB-  (living polymerization)
  Graft:              -AAAA- with B branches

Mayo-Lewis copolymerization equation:
  F₁ = (r₁f₁² + f₁f₂)/(r₁f₁² + 2f₁f₂ + r₂f₂²)
  f₁, f₂ = monomer mole fractions in feed
  F₁, F₂ = monomer mole fractions in copolymer
  r₁ = kp₁₁/kp₁₂, r₂ = kp₂₂/kp₂₁ (reactivity ratios)
  r₁r₂ = 1: ideal (random)
  r₁r₂ = 0: alternating
  r₁ > 1, r₂ < 1: M₁ preferred

Block copolymer self-assembly:
  Microphase separation at nanoscale
  Morphologies: spheres, cylinders, gyroid, lamellae
  f (volume fraction) controls morphology
  Applications: SBS (rubber), membranes, drug delivery, lithography

Important copolymers:
  SBS: styrene-butadiene-styrene (thermoplastic elastomer)
  ABS: acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (tough engineering plastic)
  EVA: ethylene-vinyl acetate (flexible packaging, hot melt)
  EPDM: ethylene-propylene-diene (rubber, O-rings)
  Nylon 6,6: alternating diamide structure

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Mn vs Mw confusion | Mn sensitive to small chains, Mw sensitive to large chains; Mw ≥ Mn always |
| Chain growth vs step growth kinetics | Chain growth: high MW early; Step growth: MW builds slowly with conversion |
| Living = no termination | Living means no irreversible termination, not literally no termination |
| Tg = melting point | Tg is glass transition (amorphous), Tm is crystal melting (different!) |
| Đ = 1 for all living | RAFT gives Đ~1.1, anionic can give Đ~1.01; living ≠ perfectly monodisperse |
| Carothers equation ignores stoichiometry | Equal moles of A and B required for high MW in A-A/B-B polymerization |
