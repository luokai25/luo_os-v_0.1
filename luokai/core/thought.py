"""
LUOKAI Tree of Thought (ToT) Reasoning Module
==============================================
Implements multi-path reasoning for complex problems.

Based on research from:
- LightAgent Tree of Thought patterns
- Google ADK reasoning chains
- DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models

The ToT approach explores multiple reasoning paths,
evaluates each one, and backtracks from failed paths
to find the optimal solution.
